"""✨ Neural render — NVIDIA DLSS 5 Neural Rendering over finished video clips.

WHAT IT IS
The DLSS 5 model (NGX feature 18, the file ``nvngx_dlssnr.dll``) re-renders a
frame's materials and lighting: skin, hair and fabric gain structure the source
only implied. It was built for games, where the engine hands it motion vectors
and depth — but the model only REQUIRES a colour frame and an output surface
(its own log says "Missing Color or Output parameter" and nothing about the
rest), which is what makes a plain video a valid input. This module runs it
over a finished clip and writes a new clip.

WHAT IT NEEDS, AND WHO SUPPLIES WHAT
* Windows and an NVIDIA GPU with a recent display driver: the model is a D3D12
  PE and its temporal mode uses the driver's Optical Flow engine. There is no
  Linux or Docker path, and this is the first capability of the app gated by
  the operating system — ``status()`` says so in words rather than showing a
  button that cannot work.
* The BRIDGE: two small MIT-licensed DLLs from the ComfyUI-DLSS5-NR project
  (github.com/lisitskyaa/ComfyUI-DLSS5-NR), which is the open-source host this
  app drives — an in-process D3D12 bridge and the caller shim the model's
  caller check demands. Setup downloads them from the pinned release
  (``BRIDGE_RELEASE``: exact URL, size and SHA-256, so a re-uploaded asset is
  refused rather than trusted).
* The MODEL: ``nvngx_dlssnr.dll`` is NVIDIA's. It is not downloaded, not
  linked and not looked for anywhere but ``runtime_dir()``. The user places
  their own copy there; the Setup card says exactly where. NVIDIA ships the
  model for the RTX 50 series; community builds for older cards exist and
  their terms are the user's to weigh — the app only reports whether a file
  is present, and relays the model's own refusal when it will not run.

HOW A CLIP IS RENDERED
Never in this process. ``infer/dlss5nr_infer.py`` is launched per clip
(see its docstring for the two hangs that decided this) and reports progress
as JSON lines; cancelling a render kills and reaps that process even while a
native frame remains silent. The interpreter and encoder belong to DLSS's
managed environment or its explicit ``plugins.dlss5.python`` override.

THE SURFACES
* The standalone DLSS studio accepts imported video files, keeps each original
  and writes a separate result. It works without any other product installed.
* The following Video integrations are optional; their media/table adapters
  stay with Video while DLSS owns the engine, routes and finishing dialogs.
* The video DATASET: a render REPLACES the clip in place — the dataset IS its
  flat folder of .mp4 + .txt, read by every trainer as-is, so a second file
  next to the clip would be trained on. The original is kept in
  ``backup_dir()``, OUTSIDE the dataset, write-once: a clip rendered twice is
  rendered from its original both times (no stacking), and 🩹 Restore puts the
  original back. Rendering keeps the caption, the row and the provenance
  columns untouched — only pixels change.
* The Video Test STUDIO: a NEW row, never an edit of the compared clip — the
  same rule as ↗ Smooth, with ``nr_of`` pointing at the source clip.
* The video BANK gets no verb: its clips are time ranges over a rush and the
  bank writes no media (``VideoClip``: "the thumbnail is the ONLY media the
  bank writes"). A render belongs to a clip that exists as a file.

THE DIALS
``tone`` and ``structure`` (0–2, default 1) are the model's own local tone and
local structure strengths; ``automask`` its automatic mask. ``intensity``,
``skin``, ``preset`` and ``style`` are NOT exposed: swept in both directions
through this bridge, they changed nothing (bit-identical output). ``tone``
matters more than it looks — at its default the model relights flat art and
greys pure whites; at 0 the tones stay and only structure is added, which is
what the "keep tones" preset in the UI sets.

``temporal`` keeps the model's history across frames with motion vectors the
driver estimates. A scene cut resets the history so the previous shot is never
smeared into the next (threshold re-measured on this app's clips: Merserk's
0.24 fired on nothing here). It needs a frame at least ``TEMPORAL_MIN_WIDTH`` px wide
(bisected: 700 fails, 704 passes, whatever the height) — ``auto`` picks it
when the clip allows it and falls back to still mode otherwise, and the
choice is reported.

Credits: the scene-cut reset and the "video-only encode, then mux the source's
audio and metadata back" shape follow Merserk's dlss5-visual-enhancer (MIT,
github.com/Merserk/dlss5-visual-enhancer). Measurements behind the constants
and the dial choices were taken on an RTX 4090, September 2026.
