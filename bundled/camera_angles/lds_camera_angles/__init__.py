"""📷 Camera angles — the bundled plugin.

Re-shoots ONE picture from other camera positions with Qwen-Image-Edit and
the Multiple-Angles LoRA: the subject stays put and the backdrop reprojects
with the camera, which no edit model does by prompting harder (the
measurement is in ``camera_angles.py``). Two surfaces carry the verb — a
Gallery image (a Test Studio render) and a dataset image — and each lands
its views next to its source.

What the plugin registers through ``lds.api``:

* the three routes the screens call (``/api/canvas/image/<id>/camera``,
  ``/api/dataset/image/<id>/camera``, ``/api/camera/catalog``);
* the four weight files Setup downloads, as Setup actions, and the one-click
  ``camera`` install group (the Qwen VAE is the Krea 2 lane's download —
  one file, one button — so the group names ``krea_vae`` as a member);
* the lane's readiness under ``comfyui.camera_missing`` /
  ``comfyui.camera_ready``, where every Setup surface reads it;
* the ``caption.stamp`` hook that keeps a view's angle phrase in its caption
  through every re-caption;
* the ``camera_unet`` slot of the model picker, listing the lane's own
  candidate walk.

The ``camera.*`` settings section stays in the core's defaults (a stored key
never moves) and is declared in the manifest's ``owns`` table.

# The weights that move the CAMERA rather than the subject.
#
# WHY A SECOND BASE MODEL AT ALL, when a 9 GB one is already installed. Measured
# on this repo's own Klein lane (2026-08-25, one reference, seed held constant):
# asked for a profile or a back view, Klein turns the PERSON and leaves the room
# exactly where it was — every phrasing tried, English, an explicit "only the
# photographer moves", the Chinese cinematography terms, with and without the
# one camera LoRA that exists for Klein 9B. The backdrop delta stayed at 11-14
# (noise) against 64-80 for a real viewpoint change. The Qwen LoRA below was
# trained on 3000+ gaussian-splatting renders — pairs where the subject cannot
# move and the background must — and reaches 64-80 on all eight angles tried.
# That inversion is the feature; it is not reachable by prompting harder.
#
# URL survey 2026-08-26 (anonymous HTTP HEAD, no token): all four answer 200 and
# the signed CDN URL carries `user_id=public` — none is access-gated. The
# 401/403 recovery path is kept anyway, like every other catalog: a
# measurement is a photograph of one moment.
#
# NOT LISTED, on purpose: the Qwen image VAE. The core's `krea_vae` already
# installs the identical file to the identical destination — a second key for
# the same bytes would put the same gigabyte on the Setup screen twice and let
# two copies drift. qwen_camera_helper.CAMERA_VAE_ACTION names that button.
#
# `dest[0]` is 'diffusion_models' for the model and 'loras' for the adapters,
# both under a `qwen/` subfolder — the same shape the Klein and Krea lanes use,
# and what qwen_camera_helper._scan looks for first.
