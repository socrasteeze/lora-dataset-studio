"""🎬 Video Test Studio API — one clip at a time, from a video LoRA.

The image studio runs a GRID: a dozen cells cost a dozen seconds and the answer
is in the contact sheet. Video does not work that way. A clip is minutes, so the
same shape here would be half an hour of waiting before the first thing anyone
could look at. This lane therefore queues ONE clip per launch and keeps a
history, and "compare" means playing two rows of that history side by side.

Everything else is deliberately the image studio's: the enqueue goes through the
same queue manager, the missing-asset refusal is the same structured 409, and
the completion callback rides the same worker thread. A user should not be able
to tell there are two services behind the app.

No login — single local user (`cfg.LOCAL_USER`), like every other blueprint here.

    ComfyUI to let go of its models, so the next clip pays the video model's
    load again — tens of gigabytes for H3 (the cost is stated in
    `/motion/suggest`). A panel that called the single-frame writers once per
    picture would pay that reload once per picture. Holding one window for the
    whole strip pays it once, which is the entire point of writing every prompt
    BEFORE the first clip is queued.

    Body `{images: [...], prompt?, model?, seconds?|frames?, shots?}` — the same
    pieces the two ✨ buttons send. A `prompt` present means ENRICH each frame
    from it (what `/motion/enhance` does for one); absent means PROPOSE from the
    frame alone (`/motion/suggest`). The panel's own rule, applied N times.

    PARTIAL RESULTS ARE THE CONTRACT. Every entry answers `{index, image,
    prompt}` or `{index, image, error}`, and the call is 200 as long as the
    window opened: one unreadable frame must not cost the eleven others their
    prompt. Only a failure to OPEN the window is an error status — there is
    nothing partial to keep then.
