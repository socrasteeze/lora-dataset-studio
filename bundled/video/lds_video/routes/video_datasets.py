"""🎬 Video datasets API — the flat folders the trainers actually read.

A video dataset is a directory of `clip_0001.mp4` files with homonym `clip_0001.txt`
captions, and nothing else. No subfolder is ever created under it: ai-toolkit's
dataset scan is `os.walk` — recursive — and excludes only dotfiles and a directory
literally named `_controls`, so anything we wrote there for our own convenience
would be trained on without a word.

This blueprint also serves the TARGET CATALOGUE, because the frontend must not
hard-code it. Two of its fields are the difference between a good week and a
wasted one: `training_verified` (we know the model's geometry, but no trainer for
it is known to exist) and `licence_note` (MiniMax H3's licence grants no rights at
all in the EU, the UK, South Korea or the USA, and the restriction reaches the
OUTPUTS — a user must not discover that in a forum thread after building a set).
