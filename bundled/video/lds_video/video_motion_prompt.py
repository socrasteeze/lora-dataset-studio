"""✨ The Motion field, written or enriched by a local LLM.

Three callers, all modelled on the image generator's: an AUTO that proposes
the clip from the start frame, an ENHANCER that takes what the user wrote and
returns a better version of it — following an instruction when the text is
one — and the launch itself ("Enrich at launch"), which is the enhancer run on
the prompt about to be rendered.

Local writing uses `vision_llm` (Ollama or LM Studio) — the only writers this
fork offers (Divergence 1: no cloud engine is ever loaded).

WHAT MAKES THE OUTPUT USABLE, and why each rule is here:

* The prompt is written in H3's OFFICIAL format — MiniMax's own writing guide,
  the one the ComfyUI text encoder was built against: three labelled fields,
  `integrated_multimodal_description:`, `overall_soundscape:` and
  `non_diegetic_music:`, the shots marked "[Shot K] At MM:SS.mmm, the camera
  cuts to" inside the first. An earlier version wrote loose prose from the
  hosted platform's guides, which even claimed bracket markers meant nothing
  to these weights; the format the open weights were trained on is this one.
* The clip's LENGTH reaches the writer. Every caller sends the seconds the
  dials are set to, and a shot directive paces the action to fill exactly that.
  A 1 s clip and a 15 s clip are not the same clip, and a writer that does not
  know which one it is writing writes the same beat for both — the defect that
  opened this port ("✨ Auto ignores the length").
* AUTO is TWO steps, never one. The vision model describes the frame as a
  FROZEN still, motion forbidden — and told to describe the scene actually in
  front of it, because a VLM asked for a still has been measured inventing a
  different one; a second call writes the clip from that description. One call
  asked to look AND compose re-described the picture and ignored every rule.
* What the format REQUIRES is guaranteed in code, never hoped from the model:
  the fields on their own lines (the scrub flattens the answer to one line on
  purpose — meta-commentary is what it removes — and the fields are rebuilt
  from their labels), the "[Shot 1]" opener, the `<Picture 1>` identity tag
  (measured missing in half the answers on the image generator's side), the
  official I2V alignment header, and a field cut mid-sentence by the token
  budget loses its orphan tail.
* A text-to-video clip has NO picture: the writer is told so, and neither the
  tag nor the header is added — a `<Picture 1>` that names nothing lies to the
  encoder, which only prepends the picture block when a frame is given.
* The graph decodes AUDIO (`VAEDecodeAudio` feeds `CreateVideo`), which is why
  the two sound fields are mandatory rather than optional.
* A refusal is a sentence, never silence: an empty return would leave the field
  as it was and look like a button that does nothing.

    embellish "she turns" and act on "make her jump instead".

    `image` is the staged start frame, when there is one: the enhancement is
    then anchored on what the clip will actually animate, so "make her turn
    toward the window" cannot invent a window, and the frame is referenced as
    <Picture 1>. Its description failing is not fatal — the text is still
    enriched, just unanchored — unless the JoyCaption method chosen in ⚙
    refused: that refusal is said, on the start frame and the last alike. No
    image means text-to-video: the writer is told there is no picture, and
    none is named or headed.

    `previous` (⏭ the parts this clip continues, most recent first) and
    `end_image` (🎞 the staged last frame) reach the writer as in
    `suggest_from_frame`; on a text-only start the last frame is the one
