Turn it on and one tile carries a cursor — K keeps it, R rejects it, P puts it back to untriaged, S or → moves on without deciding, ← steps back. They are the same keys as the image bank\'s ▶ Review, so the reflex you already have works here. The cursor then jumps to the next shot you have NOT judged yet, which on a half-triaged bank is most of the speed; untick Auto-advance and it stays put so K then R corrects the same shot. It never wraps silently: when nothing untriaged is left ahead, the bar says how many are still behind you and Home goes back to the first. U undoes the last decision and moves the cursor onto that shot so you can see what it fixed, ten steps deep, always restoring what the shot actually was before — undoing a reject on a shot you had kept puts the keep back. The offer sits in the bar rather than in a toast, because at one keystroke a second a toast is replaced before it can be read. Your keys never wait for the network either: the tile flips at once and the decisions are sent behind you, one request at a time, with a run of identical verdicts going out as a single batch and a "saving N…" counter so a run that has ended is never mistaken for a run that is saved.

      'Shot detection cuts on a change big enough to see. The ones it misses are the soft ones — a dissolve, a match cut, a new angle inside the same room — and each one leaves behind a “shot” that is really two scenes. It is the worst kind of training example, because it teaches the model a transition nobody asked for, and you cannot catch it by scrolling: the thumbnail is one of the two halves and looks perfectly fine. The 🎬 Video bank now checks every shot for this by itself, at the end of 🔎 Find scenes, and it costs nothing at all — no decoding, no model, no GPU, no button. It compares a shot’s first frame to its last using vectors that pass already cached, so a bank you embedded weeks ago gets its reading by clicking 🔎 Find scenes again. Each shot gains a scene coherence number (1.00 means its ends are the same picture), and 🎚 Quality cuts gains a Scene coherence floor that flags anything below it as “Cut inside the shot” — then ✂ Split here does the repair. Empty by default, and the Guide is blunt about why: this is a ranking, not a verdict. Measured against shots of the same length, a cut at 0.80 catches about a third of the double shots and flags about one honest shot in seven, so use it to choose what to look at first.

The 🎬 Video bank has a new 🎥 Camera pass. It tracks every frame of every shot and labels what the camera did — pan left, pan right, pan up, pan down, zoom in, zoom out, static shot, handheld shot — using the same words the video trainer itself uses, so a label here means the same thing there. Three more are ours: rolling, slideshow (a photograph panned across rather than filmed) and subject moves. The labels appear on each thumbnail and as a new 🎥 Camera row of filters above the gallery, which composes with the ⚑ flag chips — “shaky shots that also pan right” is one click each. Nothing is ever rejected: these are descriptions, not faults, because the wobble one person is filtering out is exactly what the next person is training on. If you do want to cut on it, 🎚 Quality cuts gains a Camera shake threshold, empty by default like the rest. The pass runs on the CPU at about fifteen times real time and needs only the video decode extra, which now installs OpenCV alongside PyAV — press Install on the video row in Setup if it shows a ✗. Honest limits, stated in the app too: a pivot and a slide look identical in a flat picture so both are called a pan, orbits are not detected at all, and a real pan across a wall or a horizon can read as a slideshow because it has no depth either.',

Shots that come out suspiciously smooth get a “May be AI-generated” chip, against a new cut in 🎚 Quality cuts that is empty by default and applied as you move it with nothing rescanned.

And a set re-promoted to a different target is refused rather than resumed, because the run folder still holds the previous model’s LoRA. Wan 2.2 is the one target a finished run has been through here; the card says plainly which of the others are wired but not yet proven.',

    title: 'Captions can now speak plainly instead of describing around the subject',
    blurb:
      'Next to 🗣 Describe shots there is now a Caption wording choice. Standard is the wording that shipped and stays the default. Plain gives the model explicit permission to name what is actually on screen rather than reaching for vague stand-ins. This came out of a measurement, not a hunch: on real footage, four combinations were compared and the WORDING mattered more than the model did — the stock model asked plainly named things precisely and wrote the best action description of the four, while an uncensored model asked the old way still described around the subject. That matters because a caption that talks around its footage is a dataset defect you cannot see: the text reads perfectly well, the training set looks complete, and the LoRA learns the evasion. Every caption now records which wording produced it, so a bank captioned across a change is still one you can reason about. Pick it per run, or set it once in your config.',

    title: 'Captions can now speak plainly — the model that writes them is yours to choose',
    blurb:
      'The 🗣 Describe shots pass had one model wired in. On a real corpus that turned out to be a dataset problem rather than a matter of taste: a captioner that describes what it sees in evasive terms produces captions that are about something slightly other than your footage — and a LoRA trained on those learns to look away too, with nothing in the output to reveal it. The captions read perfectly well; they are just not about the shot. So the checkpoint is now a setting, `video_caption.model`. Leave it empty and nothing changes: the same model as before, the same captions. Point it at any checkpoint of the same architecture and the pass uses that instead. Two things come with it. If the model is not on your machine yet, the pass SAYS so in its own progress line before it starts, because the first run downloads it and that should never be a silent twenty-minute wait. And every caption now records which model wrote it, so a bank captioned half before the change and half after is still a bank you can reason about.',

    blurb:
      'There is a new 🗣 Describe shots pass. It watches eight frames spread across each shot and writes what happens in it — “a woman turns and walks away”, not an inventory of objects — and that one line does two jobs. It becomes the clip’s .txt sidecar at promotion, which IS the prompt it trains on: until now every promoted clip shipped with an EMPTY prompt, and the trainer accepts that in silence. And it makes 🔎 Find scenes able to answer a question it structurally could not before. CLIP looks at frames, so it finds what a moment LOOKS like; an action is a fact about time and no single frame carries it. With captions the search reads both, and the panel says which halves are running so an empty result can be read correctly. Captions are drafts: open any shot and edit it, and a bulk re-run will not overwrite what you wrote. The promotion now also tells you how many clips are about to ship with no caption at all, before it encodes anything.',

    title: 'The per-source cap you could already read about now has a knob',
    blurb:
      'The build dialog gains a “Max clips per source” field. The cap itself is not new — it has capped nothing so far because nothing could send it: the setting was implemented and reachable from neither the dialog nor the API. It matters because a 50-clip set that is three videos over-represented looks exactly like a diverse one on disk. Leave it empty for no cap. Each source keeps its EARLIEST clips, so promoting the same bank twice gives the same dataset, and a source with fewer clips than the cap keeps all of them — it trims dominance without punishing scarcity. And when a finished set turns out to lean on one file anyway, the result now says so with the real share instead of leaving you to notice.',

    title: 'Trim the dissolve off both ends of every clip you export',
    blurb:
      'A shot boundary is where a cut just happened, so the first and last frames of a detected shot are disproportionately dissolves, fades and leftovers of a transition — and a dataset whose clips all open on half a dissolve teaches the model to open on half a dissolve. The build dialog now has a “Trim each end” field: a number of seconds taken off BOTH bounds of every clip. 0.25 is the common figure; the default is 0, so an existing recipe exports exactly what it exported before. What it will NOT do is hand you a short clip. Frame counts are a property of the target model’s VAE, and ffmpeg happily writes a 32-frame file and exits 0 when asked for 81 — so a clip that no longer supplies the count is dropped rather than exported short. The dialog tells you how many clips the trim will cost before you press the button, and counts them separately from clips that were never long enough: only the first kind is fixed by lowering the trim, and reporting them as one number is how a setting quietly halves a dataset while the material looks to blame.',

    blurb:
      'For LTX and MiniMax H3 the source’s audio is muxed into every clip you export — and until today nothing had ever listened to it. A shot whose track is a silent stretch, a dropout or a muted camera passed exactly like a shot with sound, because the file on disk is the right length, the right sample rate, and mute. A dataset of silent clips teaches the model to be silent. Measure now reports, per shot, how much of it is silence and its overall level in dBFS, with two new cuts to go with them — Silent share and Loudness floor — raising two different flags on purpose, since a quiet clip can be normalised and a silent one cannot be rescued. Three states are kept strictly apart, because collapsing any two of them makes the bank lie: a file with NO sound track is never flagged (Wan datasets are supposed to look like that), a track that is there and carries nothing is the actual defect, and shots measured before this shipped have no sound reading at all — an audio cut will never flag those, and Measure with re-measure is what fills them in.',

    blurb:
      'A video bank is a haystack whose needles have no names: quality cuts tell you which shots are sharp and which move, and nothing tells you which one has the red car in it. There is now a 🔎 Find scenes box above the gallery. Run the pass once — it looks at a few frames of every shot — then type “a woman walking on a beach” and the gallery is replaced by the shots that look most like it, best first, instantly. Several frames per shot on purpose: a car that only drives into view in the last second would be invisible to a search that had looked at the opening frame, and you would get no hint it had been missed. So every shot contributes a frame near its start, its sharpest frame and one near its end — and every result tells you WHICH SECOND matched, with the player opening right there. Two things it says out loud rather than hiding. It is a ranking, not a filter: every shot scores something against every phrase, so the results always come back full and the line above the gallery tells you how strong the top and the tail really are, plus how many shots have not been looked at yet and could not be searched at all. And “without” does not work — ask for a street without cars and you get cars, because the model ignores the word rather than honouring it. Type “-cars” instead: that pushes them down the ranking, which is a promise the app can actually keep.',

    blurb:

Open any shot and there is now a ✂ Trim & split panel under the player. Nudge either bound by one second or by one frame (one frame OF YOUR FILE, at its own rate), snap a bound to wherever the playhead sits, split a shot in two at the playhead, or draw a shot the detector missed entirely — scrub anywhere in the rush and press ＋ New shot from here. Splitting keeps the decision you were making: split a kept shot and both halves stay kept, so you do not have to find them again among hundreds. One thing worth knowing before you trim: for image-to-video targets, the trainer conditions on the clip’s FIRST frame. Moving a start is therefore not trimming — it is choosing the exact image the model learns to animate from, and the panel says so where the buttons are. Re-cut shots lose their thumbnail and their quality scores on purpose: a thumbnail of a frame the shot no longer contains is not stale, it is wrong. Run Make thumbnails again when you are done cutting. And re-detecting a file no longer destroys the cuts you made by hand.',

Nothing is rejected for you — flagged shots get an amber mark in the grid, and the verdict stays yours. The cuts are yours too: there are deliberately NO default thresholds, because the same number that flags 2% of one bank flags 12% of another. Open 🎚 Quality cuts, set a value, and Preview shows exactly how many shots each cut would flag — per rule, before anything is applied. On a real 4.5-hour test bank the most valuable filter turned out to be the frozen-stretch one: 15% of shots carried a freeze the average could never see.

    blurb:
      'Drop a video into an image bank and until today it was skipped without a word: no row, no warning, nothing to click. Videos now get their own bank. Point it at a folder of rushes and it cuts every file at its shot boundaries, so you triage SHOTS instead of files — a two-hour rush becomes three hundred things you can judge in an afternoon. Click any shot to watch exactly that moment; the grid stays thumbnails, so a bank of hundreds of shots stays as light as a page of photos. Nothing is copied and nothing is re-encoded while you triage: a bank stores where each shot starts and ends, and only the ones you keep are ever encoded. When you build the set, the length menu offers only the frame counts your target model can actually ingest — 29 frames is legal for Wan and illegal for LTX, and no trainer tells you, they just quietly round it down. Two things are written next to the target you pick, because they are what costs a wasted week: whether a LoRA trainer for it is known to exist at all (exactly one of the four), and MiniMax H3’s licence, which grants no rights in the EU, the UK, South Korea or the USA — outputs included. And if a piece is missing, the app names which one: with no ffmpeg you can still scan, cut, watch and triage everything — only the final encode waits.',
