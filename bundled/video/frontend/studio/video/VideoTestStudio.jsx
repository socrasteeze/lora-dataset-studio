/**
 * 🎬 The Video Test Studio — the video lane's answer to "is this LoRA any good".
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A GRID
 * The image studio's whole shape is a matrix: checkpoints × strengths, twelve
 * cells, twelve seconds, and the answer is in the contact sheet. A clip is
 * minutes. The same shape here would be half an hour of waiting before anything
 * could be looked at, so this queues one clip per START FRAME — a launch is
 * one clip, or one per picture in the strip, all on one seed — and keeps a
 * history: comparison happens in time (two players, same seed, one setting
 * changed) rather than in space.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE SCREEN (redesign, 2026-08-31 — "respecte le thème général")
 * A take sheet. On a wide screen the TAKE sits on the left — which LoRA, which
 * start frame, what moves — and the RENDER rail on the right stays in view
 * while you scroll: the dials and the Generate button, with a one-line readback
 * of exactly what is about to be rendered. Below, full width, the clips. On a
 * phone everything stacks and the same fixed StudioActionBar the image lane
 * uses keeps Generate one thumb away — one vocabulary for both lanes, no chrome
 * invented for this one. The first build was a flat stack of identical cards
 * with the button at the bottom, grey, under twenty rows of LoRA files.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHARES WITH THE IMAGE STUDIO
 * The queue, the missing-asset refusal, the completion callback and the LoRA
 * safety guard are all the same code. The pipeline underneath is the MiniMax H3
 * image-to-video graph this project's own video generation has been running for
 * months; nothing about the engine was reinvented for this panel.
