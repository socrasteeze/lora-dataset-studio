"""📤 Publish to Civitai — a trained checkpoint as a model page, and the images it
generated as posts on that page, without leaving the app.

Two gestures, one credential:

* **the checkpoint** (a pill on the ◉ Graph / LoRA Canvas) becomes a Civitai
  model page — model → version → the `.safetensors` uploaded in 25 MB parts →
  the file registered on the version. The page is created as a DRAFT unless
  the user ticks "publish now": a model page deserves a last look on Civitai
  (cover images, licence, description) before the world sees it;
* **a generated image** (the shared viewer's 📤 verb) becomes a post on the
  version its checkpoint is linked to, carrying the prompt, seed, sampler and
  the LoRA weight it was made with, so the picture files itself under the
  right model with its generation data. That post is published right away by
  default — that is what "post it" means — and can be left as a draft instead.

The two meet on the LINK: `civitai_link` remembers which Civitai model version
a SAVE is — keyed by `(record_id, step, filename)`, three columns because a
run that ends on a numbered save writes two files at its last step (the
numbered one and the step-less final) and the step alone cannot tell them
apart (see models.CivitaiLink). Marking the page first (paste its URL, or
create it from here) is what makes the image gesture a single press later.

A picture names its save without a file name: its row carries the checkpoint
stamped at generation (`record_id`, `step`) and the DEPLOYED LoRA name it ran
with (`checkpoint`, e.g. `lora_x_000001500_Krea-2-Raw_rc158_v1`). The
zero-padded step block that name carries is what tells the numbered save from
the final when both sit at one step, so every entry point takes that name as a
`hint` and resolves the save server-side — a picture can mark its page, and
create it, without ever being asked "which file".

That stamp is NULL for every picture made with a run's FINAL save (its deployed
name carries no step). So "pick one of this dataset's linked pages" is the
ordinary path for those, not a degraded one, and the link store is queried by
dataset as much as by checkpoint.

The Civitai side is the site's own tRPC + upload endpoints, authenticated by
the API key (Bearer, no cookie) — the same key the scraper and the 🌐 prompt
browser already read, so the app holds ONE Civitai credential. The call chain
(model.upsert → modelVersion.upsert → /api/upload → /api/upload/complete →
modelFile.upsert; /api/v1/image-upload → post.create → post.addImage) was
exercised end to end against the live site before being written here; the
publish mutations (`model.publish`, `post.update {publishedAt}`) follow the
site's own source and are optional at every step. `model.publish` is sent
WITHOUT a timestamp on purpose: the server stamps its own "now", and a PC
clock running ahead would otherwise file the page as *scheduled* instead of
published. A post's timestamp is taken from the server's `Date` header for
the same reason.

Privacy is a boundary, not a checkbox. Every image leaves as a fresh PNG with
no embedded metadata (the generation data travels EXPLICITLY in `meta`, never
as a ComfyUI workflow blob that can name local paths), every outgoing text is
run through the path/token redactors, and the checkpoint's own safetensors
metadata is scanned for a home path before a single byte is uploaded.

Uploads take minutes on a home uplink, so both flows run as background jobs
(`start_job` / `job_status`) the modal polls — the same shape hf_publish uses.
`publish_model` and `post_images` themselves are synchronous and are the seams
the tests drive, with the network replaced through `_transport`.
