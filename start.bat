REM --- Pick a Python the OPTIONAL ML extras have wheels for (CPython 3.10-3.12).
REM     insightface / numpy<2 / onnxruntime publish NO wheels for 3.13+, so a venv
REM     built on e.g. 3.14 cannot install requirements-ml.txt (pip falls back to
REM     source builds that fail). `py -3.x` selects an EXACT version; bare `py -3`
REM     or `python` grab the NEWEST installed one -- which is exactly the trap.

REM 3) Nothing suitable -> fetch a self-contained CPython 3.12 automatically: no
REM    system install, no admin, nothing added to PATH. This is what lets start.bat
REM    be a true one-click launcher even on a machine with no Python at all. Needs

REM --- Call the venv's python DIRECTLY everywhere below -- never `activate.bat`.
REM     A venv carries hardcoded paths; if it was ever moved or copied (e.g. a
REM     provisioning step that builds it elsewhere then relocates it), its
REM     activate.bat no longer shadows the system python, so `call activate` +
REM     `python` silently falls back to the machine default (the 3.14 trap). The
REM     python.exe stub, by contrast, always resolves to the venv interpreter.

REM --- Ensure .venv exists AND runs a supported Python; rebuild it otherwise

REM --- Health check: a .venv can EXIST and be on a supported Python yet still be

REM     that clobbered a core dep) survives every update -- and `pip -r` below can't
REM     repair a package it still thinks is satisfied. If an EXISTING venv can't
REM     import the core stack, rebuild it from scratch. Only worthwhile when a
REM     supported Python is available. NOTE: a Pillow-only MIX (Image.py 12 + old
REM     plugin) still imports here and is repaired at app boot by
REM     bootstrap_dependencies.ensure_pillow_consistent -- no need to nuke for that.
