# LoRA Dataset Studio, started inside the ComfyUI-Nvidia container.
#
# Installed as /userscripts_dir/50-lora-dataset-studio.sh, which upstream's
# init.bash runs in sorted order as the `comfy` user — AFTER the WANTED_UID/GID
# remap and ComfyUI's venv install, BEFORE ComfyUI itself launches. That hook is the
# whole seam between this app and mmartial/comfyui-nvidia-docker: no ENTRYPOINT
# override, one script, at their documented extension point.
#
# This script must ALWAYS exit 0 and must never `set -e`. Upstream calls it as
# `$userscript || error_exit "..."`, so a non-zero return aborts the boot — and a
# problem with the studio must never cost the user their ComfyUI.

#
# Backgrounded on purpose. This walks ~7 GB of torch, and upstream runs this hook
# BEFORE it launches ComfyUI — so doing it inline would hold up both services for
# minutes on every container recreate. The studio only needs to READ the venv to
# run; ownership matters solely so the in-app dependency installer can pip into it.
