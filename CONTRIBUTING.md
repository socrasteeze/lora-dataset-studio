# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to make LoRA Dataset Studio better. This is a small, self-hosted, volunteer project — issues, ideas and pull requests are all welcome.

## Before you write code

For anything bigger than a typo or a one-line fix, **talk about it first**. It saves you from building something that's already in progress or that doesn't fit the direction.

- **Discord** ([join](https://discord.gg/j6hnJBFtXE)) — usually the fastest way. Ask in **#help**; float feature ideas in **#feature-requests**; talk implementation in **#dev-chat**. The curated **#community-ideas** board shows what people voted for (the roadmap follows it), and **#roadmap** shows what's shipped and coming.
- **[GitHub issues](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/issues)** — bug reports and feature requests. There are templates for both; for a bug, the app can write most of the report for you (**Guide → Getting help → Copy diagnostic report** — it includes version, OS and a log tail, no keys, no paths).

A quick "I'm going to look at X" in an issue or on Discord means nobody duplicates your work.

## Dev setup

You only need the backend to work on backend code. You only need Node to change the frontend.

### Backend

Use **CPython 3.10–3.12**. This matters: the optional ML extras (`insightface`, `onnxruntime`, `numpy<2`, …) publish no wheels for 3.13+, so a venv built on a newer Python (a bare `python`/`py -3` often grabs 3.13/3.14) can't install them. Pick the version explicitly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio.git
cd lora-dataset-studio

python -m venv .venv                 # on Windows: py -3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# optional, only if you're touching face scoring / masks / watermark inpainting:
pip install -r backend/requirements-ml.txt
# optional, only if you're touching the scraper:
pip install -r backend/requirements-scrape.txt

python backend/run.py
```

`run.py` re-execs itself into `.venv` if it exists, so every launch method converges on the same interpreter. On Windows you can instead just double-click **`start.bat`**, which finds (or downloads) a suitable Python, builds the venv, and starts the server on port **5050**.

### Frontend

Use **Node.js 22.22 or newer**. The repo **ships the frontend prebuilt** in `frontend/dist/` (that folder is committed on purpose — `start.bat` and the Docker/portable builds serve it directly and never run Node). So:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # live-reload dev server; proxies /api to the backend on :5050
npm run build    # writes frontend/dist/
```

⚠ **`npm run dev` drives a real backend.** `/api` is proxied to `http://127.0.0.1:5050` — your actual install — and write requests go through. Set `LDS_DEV_API_TARGET` (shell, or `frontend/.env.local`) to point it at a throwaway instance instead; see [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).

**If you change anything under `frontend/src`, run `npm run build` and commit the regenerated `frontend/dist/` in the same PR** — otherwise people running from source won't see your change. There's no TypeScript/ESLint step; a clean `npm run build` is the bar.

On this fork the rebuilt bundle goes in **its own `build(frontend):` commit**
rather than mixed into the source commit — same PR, separate commit. The
requirement is that dist ships with the change, not that it shares a commit with
it; `CLAUDE.md` step 2 is only about that granularity. A PR that changes
`frontend/src` and carries no dist at all is incomplete either way.

**This fork is local-only for image generation** (no Nano Banana / OpenAI Setup
keys). After merging upstream, rebuild `frontend/dist` even if you only took
upstream's dist commit — Flask serves the bundle, and upstream's can resurrect
removed UI. See `FORK_NOTES.md` and run
`node --test tests/local-only-engines-contract.test.mjs` from `frontend/`.

Flask serves `frontend/dist` **off disk, per request**, so a rebuilt bundle
reaches every browser the moment it is written while the Python process keeps
running the code it started with. If you rebuild without restarting, you are
running a new frontend against an old backend — which is a real bug source, not
a theoretical one (see `frontend/src/components/bank/bankIds.js`).

## Tests

The backend has a large test suite (950+ tests) and it must stay green:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt   # pytest + the two test-only ML extras
# optional: execute the 16 Torch/ai-toolkit bridge runtime tests instead of skipping them
pip install -r backend/requirements-torch-tests.txt
python -m pytest backend/tests -q
```

`requirements-dev.txt` is the common CI/release baseline. CI adds the CPU-only `requirements-torch-tests.txt` overlay when training-state code changes (and for manual runs), while the release job always adds it. A suite green against a different set of packages is not evidence about CI: a stray `pytest-flask` on one dev machine once made nine tests pass locally and fail on the release tag. (The suite runs with `-p no:flask` for that reason; you do not need to uninstall anything.)

This is exactly what CI runs on a release tag, so run it locally before you open a PR. If you add or change behavior, add or update a test for it. The suite mocks external tools (ComfyUI, ai-toolkit, Ollama), so it runs without a GPU or any of those installed.

For the frontend, a successful `npm run build` is the check.

## Pull requests

- **Keep PRs small and focused** — one change per PR reviews faster and reverts cleanly.
- **Explain the *why*, not just the what.** What problem does this solve? Link the issue or Discord thread if there is one. The feature-request template's framing applies here too: the job you're doing matters more than the mechanism.
- **UI text is English.** Match the tone of what's already there — concrete and direct.
- **Screenshots for any UI change** (before/after if you're changing something that exists).
- **No secrets or local paths.** Don't commit API keys, tokens, `config.json`, `.env`, or absolute paths from your machine — and scrub them from screenshots, logs and PR descriptions too. `.gitignore` already covers the usual suspects; the diagnostic report is built to be paste-safe for the same reason.
- Be kind. See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Already running your own fork?

Several people run a modified copy, and that is exactly what the MIT licence is
for — take it wherever you need it, no permission required, no obligation to
send anything back.

But if you have fixed something along the way that would help everyone, we would
genuinely like it. A fork usually carries two very different kinds of change:

- **Your product decisions** — engines you removed, defaults you disagree with,
  behaviour you shaped around your own workflow. Keep them. They are why you
  forked, and upstreaming them would only make your next merge harder.
- **The fixes underneath them** — a path that only resolved on your machine, a
  message that named the wrong cause, a crash on a layout we never tested. Those
  are ours too, and they are usually a small diff sitting inside a much larger
  branch.

You do not have to disentangle them yourself. **Open an issue describing what you
fixed and point at the commit in your fork** — that is enough. If it is a
one-file change you would rather just send, open the PR straight from your fork
(GitHub keeps the base repo correct by default).

Worth knowing: fixes reported this way get credited to you by name in the commit
and in the release notes, same as anyone else.

## Getting oriented

The product docs double as a map of what the app does and why:

- [`README.md`](README.md) — architecture in one pass, the feature list, run modes, and the **Legal & responsible use** section (please read it — this project has hard lines around real people and consent).
- [`docs/guide/`](docs/guide/) — the in-app manual (getting started, using the app, troubleshooting, getting help).
- [`docs/DATASET_GUIDE.md`](docs/DATASET_GUIDE.md) — how good datasets are built, which informs a lot of the product decisions.

## Security

Found a vulnerability? Please **don't** open a public issue — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for how to report it privately.
