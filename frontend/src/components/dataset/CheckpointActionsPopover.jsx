/* ◉ THE checkpoint actions popover — one component, two surfaces.

   It used to be ~90 lines of JSX inlined in RunLineageGraph.jsx, which meant the
   LoRA Canvas had no actions at all: clicking a pill there could only tick it.
   Copying the block over would have produced two popovers that agree today and
   drift on the first change — the exact failure the card, the pill and the edges
   were extracted to avoid (lineageNodes.jsx / lineageEdges.jsx). So it moved
   here, whole, and both surfaces mount THIS one. A contract test fails if either
   grows its own.

   Presentational: every decision arrives from checkpointActionModel (pure,
   unit-tested) and every action arrives as a prop. It fetches nothing and knows
   nothing about which screen it is on — the host owns the positioning, because
   that is the one thing the two surfaces genuinely do differently.

   `pill` may be null. A click on a run CARD opens the same popover with only its
   run-level row (ⓘ Details), which is what took the detail drawer off the
   click: it now opens because it was asked for, not because a card was touched. */

// Disabled rows are TEXT, not buttons: a greyed-out button invites the click it
// will not honour. This states the situation and gets out of the way.
