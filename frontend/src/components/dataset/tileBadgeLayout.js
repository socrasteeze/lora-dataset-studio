/* Where the provenance badge ("generated · face · Krea 2 Edit") sits on a
   dataset tile — and the ONE place that number is written down.

   PURE JS (no JSX) so `node --test` can import and exercise it directly.

   THE BUG THIS ENCODES
   --------------------
   The badge was pinned top-LEFT and the action buttons (🔄 ✏️ ⇆ ✂ 🗑) top-RIGHT,
   with nothing arbitrating between them. Measured in a browser, the button row
   is ~147 px wide and the longest badge ~172 px (measured upstream on its
   longest engine name; this fork's longest is the shorter "generated · face ·
   Krea 2 Edit", so the threshold below is conservative here, never too small):
   they need ~336 px of tile to coexist. A 400-px phone at tile size M
   gives 188 px, so the badge ran 113 px UNDER the buttons and the engine name —
   the whole point of the badge — became unreadable. It only shows on touch
   devices: `@media (hover: hover)` hides the buttons at rest, so a mouse user
   never sees the collision.

   WHY A CONTAINER QUERY AND NOT A VIEWPORT MEDIA QUERY
   ----------------------------------------------------
   Tile width is a product of BOTH the S/M/L setting (2/2/1 columns on a phone,
   6/4/3 on a desktop) AND the window width. A viewport media query gets it
   backwards at both ends: size L on a 400-px phone is a 384-px tile with room
   to spare, size S on a 1400-px desktop is a 228-px tile with none. Only the
   tile's own inline size answers the question, so `.dataset-grid-item` is a
   size-query container (the repo already does this in WatermarkReviewLightbox)
   and the badge reads that container, not the window. The alternative — keying
   off the `tileSize` prop in JS — would have needed a second, viewport-based
   rule bolted on to cover the window axis, i.e. the same wrong tool with extra
   steps, plus a re-render on every resize. CSS does it with zero JS.

   The JS below is the SPEC of that CSS rule; tileBadgeLayout.test.js asserts the
   stylesheet still matches it, so the two cannot drift apart. */
