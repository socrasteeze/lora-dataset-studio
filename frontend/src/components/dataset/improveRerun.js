/**
 * 🔄 Re-run of the ✨ Upscale & improve pass, for a tile that IS an improvement.
 *
 * The generic regenerate button is deliberately hidden on these tiles: that route
 * restarts from the dataset's reference photo and the catalog prompt, so it would
 * quietly produce an unrelated variation instead of a better version of THIS
 * image. The right gesture is to run the improve pass again, from the same parent
 * image, with the settings as they are today (klein.improve_steps, megapixels,
 * base/consistency strength and the improvement instruction are all editable —
 * tuning them is the only reason to re-run).
 *
 * Kept in plain .js (no JSX) so `node --test` can exercise the decision itself.
