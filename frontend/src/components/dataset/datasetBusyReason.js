/* WHY A DATASET WRITE IS REFUSED RIGHT NOW — one sentence, not a grey button.
 *
 * THE COMPLAINT THIS ANSWERS. "During an image generation every action around
 * the dataset is blocked — opening the lightbox, deleting a photo…". One
 * `busy` flag guarded the WHOLE tile, so a pass that touches pixels also
 * switched off inspecting and ticking, which conflict with nothing. Reads are
 * unblocked in the components; this file is the other half — the writes that
 * legitimately stay refused now SAY SO instead of going quietly grey.
 *
 * NOTHING NEW IS COMPOSED HERE. The Bank solved this exact problem first
 * ("A Bank being built is inspectable, never mutable or deletable") and
 * `bank/bankPassRun.js::busyLine` already builds the sentence: blocker, then
 * progress, then time left, then the running phase. Only the VOCABULARY was
 * bank-specific, so that function took a `labels`/`subject` pair and this file
 * supplies the Dataset's. Both surfaces therefore gain a future improvement to
 * the sentence (the ETA clause landed that way) at the same time, and cannot
 * drift into two dialects of the same refusal.
 *
 * Plain .js (no JSX) so `node --test` can execute all of it.
