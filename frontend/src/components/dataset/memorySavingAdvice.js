/* Memory-saving levers (Advanced options → Memory saving) — the pure bits, kept
   out of TrainingPanel.jsx so `node --test` can exercise the copy directly (the
   test runner does not parse JSX).

   Community request: GitHub issue #14 (bobba84) — "Disable Quant / LowVRAM for
   Z-Image Training. I have a 5090."

   Two rules this module exists to keep honest:

   1. ADVISING IS NOT DECIDING. The detected VRAM only chooses a SENTENCE. It
      never writes a setting, never blocks a launch, and a machine that cannot be
      probed (no NVIDIA card, nvidia-smi missing, a laptop that only drives cloud
      runs) gets a generic line rather than a guess.
   2. THE FAILURE MODE IS SLOWNESS, NOT A CRASH. On Windows/WDDM there is no
      clean out-of-memory error when a run no longer fits: the driver pages to
      system RAM and training creeps for hours. A vague "you may run out of
      memory" would send people hunting for an error that never arrives, so the
      "too small" and "unknown" branches both name the symptom explicitly. */

/* The amber line under the checkboxes when a saver the CURRENT family's recipe
   relies on is switched off — the panel half of the server's `memory_risk`
   (lora_training.memory_saving_risk, which is also what the preflight reads).

   Why this exists at all: these three flags live in one global `train_settings`
   blob while the calibrated default is per family. Switching an off-by-default
   2B family (Anima, SDXL) to a 12B DiT carried the `false` over and produced a
   config with no quantisation, no low-VRAM streaming and no qtype — a recipe
   that OOMs or crawls, built in silence. The flags still travel (they are a
   statement about the CARD, not about the family, so remembering them per family
   would answer a question nobody asked); what changes is that they are now said
   out loud on the family that cannot afford them.

   Returns null when the recipe is intact — the common case, which must stay
   visually silent. `risk` is the server payload; nothing is recomputed here. */
