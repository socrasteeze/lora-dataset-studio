/* Editing the ✨ Upscale & improve instruction FROM the screen that runs it.
   PURE JS (JSX-free) so `node --test` can exercise every decision here.

   WHAT IS BEING WRITTEN, AND HOW WIDE IT REACHES
   ----------------------------------------------
   `identity_prompts.klein_improve` is the GLOBAL setting — the very value the
   Settings page edits. There is no per-image and no per-run copy. That is a
   deliberate choice, not a shortcut: a second place to store "the improve
   instruction" would mean two answers to "what will improve ask for?", and the
   whole reason this note exists is that the user could not get ONE answer
   (Qeeyana, Reddit — see kleinImproveHint.js). A wide setting is a fixable
   problem; two truths are not.

   Which is exactly why the panel must SAY it is global. A control that sits
   inside a dataset's lightbox looks per-dataset. `IMPROVE_SCOPE_NOTE` is the
   sentence that stops that misread, and it is rendered unconditionally — not on
   hover, not behind a tooltip.

   STORAGE CONTRACT (backend: face_variations.get_identity_prompt,
   face_dataset_service._improve_prompt):
     · `klein_improve` is a FLAT key — subject-agnostic, unlike its neighbours,
       so nothing here goes through identity_prompts.by_subject.
     · '' means "follow the shipped default", which arrives separately in
       `identity_prompt_defaults.klein_improve`. Storing a copy of the default
       would silently pin the user to today's wording forever — the collapse
       back to '' lives in promptOverride.js and is shared with Settings.
     · `klein_improve_enabled === false` means no instruction at all.

   The SERVER stays the authority: PUT /api/settings deep-merges and returns the
   full payload, so the panel re-reads what was actually stored rather than
   trusting what it sent. */

/** The raw split of the improve setting, read from a /api/settings payload.
 *  `stored` is what config holds ('' = following the default), `shipped` the
 *  built-in text. Both are needed at once by the editor: the box shows the
 *  effective text while the STORE only ever receives the override. */

/** The text improve will actually send, given a {stored, shipped} pair.
 *  Mirrors readImproveInstruction's rule byte for byte — a contract test in

 *
 *  Typing emits one change per keystroke and each one must NOT become a settings
 *  write. Pending fields merge into ONE patch and one request, so editing the

 *
 *  `flush()` exists for the case that actually loses work: closing the lightbox
 *  mid-sentence. The component calls it on unmount, so the last keystroke is
 *  saved instead of dying with the timer.
