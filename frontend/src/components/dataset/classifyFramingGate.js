// import (the default on body-fidelity datasets) therefore leaves the bar at 0 with
// no way out inside the app: the vision pass that fills those framings exists
// (POST /api/dataset/<id>/classify) but had no trigger.
//
// The set this module counts is EXACTLY the set the server pass acts on
// (face_dataset_service.classify_images: source='import' AND framing IS NULL) —
// including rejected rows, which the pass classifies too. Counting the composition
// buckets instead would under-report and the button would promise less than it does.
