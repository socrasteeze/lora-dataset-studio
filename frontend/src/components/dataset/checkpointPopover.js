/* Pure brain of the checkpoint ACTIONS popover — the one that opens on a
   checkpoint pill and offers ⬇ Download, ▶ Continue from here, 📦 Deploy,
   ⏏ Undeploy, 🗑 Delete and ⓘ Details.

   JSX-free on purpose. `node --test` does not parse JSX, and these are exactly
   the decisions that must not be eyeballed in a popover: WHICH actions a given
   checkpoint may offer, and — when it may not — WHY. The rule this file exists
   to enforce is the app's own: an action is either live, or shown disabled with
   its real reason, or absent. Never a button that fails in silence.

   The geometry lives here too, for the same reason: a popover that leaves its
   frame is a bug you can only see at one window size, and the app is consulted
   on a 400-px phone where it is the normal case rather than the edge one. Two
   placements, because the two surfaces host it in two different spaces:

     • the graph embedded in a run card draws it INSIDE its <svg>, in world
       units, so it is clamped against the graph's own box;
     • the LoRA Canvas floats it above a zoomed, panned board, so it is placed
       in SCREEN pixels at a constant size — a popover that scaled with the
       board would be unreadable at the zoom levels the board is useful at. */
