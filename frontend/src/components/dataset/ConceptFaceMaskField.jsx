/* Concept face masking — the Advanced training option and its preview.
   Reported by shivdbz2010 (GitHub issue #15): a concept LoRA also learns the faces
   of its dataset, so combining it with a character LoRA makes the two fight over
   the identity.

   Everything here is DECISION support, placed where the decision is made (next to
   the checkbox, before training), not in the image grid where it would be a
   curiosity. Three things are visible before you commit:
     - what the mask would actually cover, drawn on your own photos;
     - what the head-coverage setting does, redrawn live as you drag it;
     - how many images got no face at all, because a PARTLY masked set is the bad
       case: the faces left unmasked are then the only ones carrying loss weight.

   The overlay idiom (normalised coords -> percentage-positioned absolute divs over
   a relative wrapper) is the one WatermarkRegionEditor already uses; the geometry
   lives in utils/faceMaskBox.js, mirrored from the Python that paints the real mask. */
