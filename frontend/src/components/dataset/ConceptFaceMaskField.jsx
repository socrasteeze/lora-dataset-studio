/* Concept face masking — the Advanced training option and its preview.
   Reported by shivdbz2010 (GitHub issue #15): a concept LoRA also learns the faces
   of its dataset, so combining it with a character LoRA makes the two fight over
   the identity.

   Everything here is DECISION support, placed where the decision is made (next to
   the checkbox, before training), not in the image grid where it would be a
   curiosity. Three things are visible before you commit:
     - what the mask would actually cover, drawn on your own photos;
     - what the head-coverage setting does, redrawn live as you drag it;
     - how many images got no face at all, because a PARTLY masked set is the bad
       case: the faces left unmasked are then the only ones carrying loss weight.

   The overlay idiom (normalised coords -> percentage-positioned absolute divs over
   a relative wrapper) is the one WatermarkRegionEditor already uses; the geometry
   lives in utils/faceMaskBox.js, mirrored from the Python that paints the real mask. */

        faces it was trained on, and then pulls against a character LoRA over whose face to
        render. This weighs the detected faces down in the training loss, so the concept
        binds to the act rather than to the people in your photos. Your images are never
        altered — nothing is blurred or painted over, only the loss is re-weighted.

        the concept itself and no mask fully makes up for it. Nobody has published a measured
        before/after of face masking on a concept LoRA — this gives you the lever, not a promise.
