/* What "✨ Upscale & improve" is about to ASK Klein, said where the button is.
   PURE JS (JSX-free) so node --test can import it.

   THE REPORTED PROBLEM (Qeeyana, Reddit). "Using the Klein quality inpaint often
   harms the image by making textures realistic despite images being anime […]
   would help to be able to tweak the settings. Maybe there is but I can't find
   it." Both halves were true at once: the levers all existed (the instruction
   itself, its on/off toggle, four strength knobs) and NONE of them was named on
   the screen where the damage happens. The lightbox carried a single "Adjust
   improve strength →" link, which points at the knobs — not at the sentence that
   was actually doing it.

   And the sentence is the whole story. The shipped default reads "add detailed
   texture, add sharp details, add candid shot, add soft focus effect": a recipe
   for a photograph, applied identically to every dataset, anime included. A user
   who READS those eight words needs no documentation to understand why their
   drawing came back with skin pores. So the fix is not another link — it is
   quoting the instruction, live, next to the button.

   LIVE, not the shipped text: the box is editable and switchable off, and a
   hint that describes the default to someone who has already changed it is worse
   than no hint. Hence the {loaded, enabled, prompt} shape — everything here is a
   pure function of what the server actually holds. */

/**
 * The EFFECTIVE improve instruction, read from a /api/settings payload.

 * default", and `klein_improve_enabled === false` means no prompt at all.
 * A payload that has not arrived (or that failed) yields loaded:false, never a
