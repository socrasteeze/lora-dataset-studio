/**
 * Moving from one inspected image to the next, and the state that must NOT come
 * with it.
 *
 * ── Which list ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The lightbox walks the list the grid SHOWS — filtered, sorted, in the grid's
 * own order — not the raw dataset payload. Anything else would send ⟩ to an
 * image the user cannot see behind the overlay, and "where am I" becomes
 * unanswerable. Paging is a rendering window over that same list (the pager
 * says "1–500 of 6211", and "select all" already means every page), so
 * navigation crosses page boundaries and the grid follows underneath — closing
 * the lightbox never lands you on a page that does not contain the image you
 * were just looking at.
 *
 * Small-image rescue rows are traversed like anything else, and deliberately:
 * the grid only ever renders the RESOLVED winner of a rescue pair (the unresolved
 * pairs live in Curation and never reach this list), so a rescue winner is an
 * ordinary tile on screen. Skipping it would make ⟩ jump over a picture the user
 * is looking at. What the grid withholds from them is the tick box — a bulk
 * action on a paired provenance — which is a different question from "show me
 * the next picture".
 *
 * ── The state that must not travel ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Zoom, the comparison pane and "an improvement is running" are properties of
 * ONE image. Carried onto the next one they range from merely wrong (a 100 %
 * zoom on a picture you have not looked at yet) to dangerous (a pane captioned
 * "original" showing the parent of the PREVIOUS image).
 *
 * The guarantee here is structural rather than a reset effect: the state is
 * stamped with the id it was computed for, and a render that finds a foreign
 * stamp ignores it and uses a fresh one. There is therefore no frame in which
 * stale state is painted, and no ordering to get right.
 *
 * READING a foreign stamp is not enough on its own, because there is ONE slot.
 * A late writer — the `finally` of an improve that started on the previous
 * image — would stamp that slot with its own id, and the read would then find a
 * foreign stamp for the image actually on screen and hand it a FRESH state:
 * your zoom dropped and your comparison pane closed, on an image that improve
 * never touched. Measured, not feared. So writing checks the stamp too, and a
 * writer that no longer owns the screen is dropped: see `stampedPatch`.
 */

/**
 * Everything an image starts from, whatever the previous one ended on.
 *
 * `compareMode` is a MODE, not a flag: the lightbox offers two comparisons —
 * against the original an improve pass came from, and against the dataset's
 * reference photo — and they are mutually exclusive, so 'none' | 'derived' |
 * 'reference' is the honest shape. It replaced a boolean `comparing`; keeping
 * the state in one slot is what makes "moving image closes whichever pane was
 * open" true for both without a second reset path.
 *
 * `actionsOpen` — the narrow-screen actions panel — lives here for the same
 * reason, not because a panel belongs to a picture: it is a full-screen overlay
 * on a phone, and ⟩ pressed behind it would otherwise land you on an image you
 * cannot see, under a panel you did not reopen. Sharing the stamped slot makes
 * "moving image gives you the picture back" structural, like the two panes.
