/* The ONE delete action a pill offers, and WHICH of the two files it aims at.

     deployed pill  → the COPY IN COMFYUI (train/checkpoint/delete). The run's
                      save is untouched, so no run-folder space is freed and the
                      pill falls back to "not deployed" — where the same action
                      then aims at the save.
     plain pill     → the TRAINING SAVE in the run folder
                      (train/run-checkpoint/delete), a cloud pill by its
                      cloud_run_id.

   "Deployed" is read from checkpointDeployed(pill) — the SAME source of truth
   that decides between "✓ Deployed" and "Import → loras/…", never a second one.
   The deployed target needs the deployed copy's own name (`deployed_filename`,
   which the lineage resolves from the very map that sets `testable`): without it
   the route would reject an unknown checkpoint, so the action is withheld.

   Returns null when there is nothing to delete: a `gone` pill, an unresolvable
   body, or a cloud run still in flight (its pod keeps syncing epochs down, so a
   deletion would race the sync — the flat checkpoint list hides its 🗑 for
   exactly those runs). The server keeps the authoritative guards (it refuses
