/* ◉ The edges of a lineage — the flowing bezier connectors that read parent→child.

   Extracted from RunLineageGraph.jsx so the LoRA Canvas draws the SAME edges as
   the in-card graph rather than a lookalike: same gradients, same trunk
   brightening, same dashed-and-dimmed superseded branch, same draw-in delay.

   ⚠ SVG gradient/filter ids are DOCUMENT-global. `LineageEdgeDefs` must be
   rendered exactly ONCE per page: the in-card graph puts it inside its own
   <svg>, while the canvas — which draws one <svg> per dataset lane — renders it
   once at page level and every lane references the same four ids. Rendering it
   per lane would be N copies of the same id in one document; `url(#…)` would
   still resolve (to the first), but it would be a lie waiting to become a bug
   the day the definitions differ. */
