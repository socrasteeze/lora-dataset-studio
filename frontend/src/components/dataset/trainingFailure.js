/** What a FAILED local training run should actually show.
 *
 *  The panel used to print the raw tail of training.log in red. ai-toolkit's
 *  first output is normally a harmless `FutureWarning` from huggingface_hub, so
 *  a run that died before writing anything else showed that warning as if it
 *  were the cause — hours lost chasing a deprecation notice (reported by
 *  wannadecryptor on Discord). The backend now sends `excerpt` = the part of the
 *  log that explains the failure, with an explicit `kind`; this helper turns
 *  that into a rendering decision, and it stays a plain module so it can be
 *  tested without a DOM.
 *
 *  Rules:
 *   - a traceback / error line is a CAUSE      -> red, quoted as the reason;
 *   - nothing error-like in the log            -> neutral, said plainly, with a
 *                                                 pointer to the full log. A
 *                                                 warning is never dressed up
 *                                                 as a cause;
 *   - a GPU-architecture verdict, when present -> replaces the generic
 *                                                 "common first-run causes"
 *                                                 guesswork with the real one.
