/* The two drawers the lineage graph opens must be readable on a 400-px phone.
   Both are BOTTOM SHEETS below `sm` and side drawers from `sm` up. The detail
   panel used to be `w-80` at every width, which on a 400-px screen covered 80%
   of the very board it annotates — you could read a run's settings but no
   longer see the run. Pinned here because it is invisible to every other test:
   a rewrite of the panel would silently drop the fix (a class is not behaviour,
