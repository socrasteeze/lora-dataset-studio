/* The two drawers the lineage graph opens must be readable on a 400-px phone.
   Both are BOTTOM SHEETS below `lg` and side drawers from `lg` up. The detail
   panel used to be `w-80` at every width, which on a 400-px screen covered 80%
   of the very board it annotates — you could read a run's settings but no
   longer see the run. Pinned here because it is invisible to every other test:
   a rewrite of the panel would silently drop the fix (a class is not behaviour,
   nothing throws), and this is the panel opened most often on a phone.

   The switch used to happen at `sm` (640 px). Measured on the real board, that
   was one breakpoint too early: these drawers are a FIXED width, so a 768-px
   window — what a phone in landscape reports — got a 320/352-px drawer over a
   ~400-px sliver of board, which is the same failure the sheet exists to avoid,
   just less extreme. A side drawer only earns its keep once what remains is
   still a readable board, i.e. from `lg` (1024 px). Nothing at or above 1024 px
   changed. */
