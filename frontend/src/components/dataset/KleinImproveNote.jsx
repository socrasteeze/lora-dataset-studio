/* The "here is what improve will ask for, and here is where to change it" line,
   rendered wherever ✨ Upscale & improve can be triggered (the lightbox and the
   grid's bulk toolbar). Reasoning, and the report behind it, in kleinImproveHint.js.

   ONE fetch, shared: /api/settings is a full settings payload and this note can
   mount several times per screen (every lightbox open, the bulk toolbar). The
   module-level promise below is the whole cache — with a short TTL, because a
   user who goes to Settings, edits the instruction and comes straight back must
   not be shown the text they just replaced. A failed request stays loaded:false
   and the note degrades to "there IS an instruction, it is editable" rather than
   inventing its content.

   Deliberately NOT a second editor: the instruction is already editable in
   Settings ▸ Image engines ▸ Identity & Klein prompts, with a per-subject picker
   and a Reset. A copy of that field here would be a second write path to a value
   several screens read. This note quotes and points; it never sets. */
