/* The "here is what improve will ask for, and here is where to change it" block,
   rendered wherever ✨ Upscale & improve can be triggered (the dataset lightbox,
   the grid's bulk toolbar, the generated-image lightbox). Reasoning, and the
   report behind it, in kleinImproveHint.js.

   ONE fetch, shared: /api/settings is a full settings payload and this note can
   mount several times per screen (every lightbox open, the bulk toolbar). The
   module-level promise below is the whole cache — with a short TTL, because a
   user who goes to Settings, edits the instruction and comes straight back must
   not be shown the text they just replaced. A failed request stays loaded:false
   and the note degrades to "there IS an instruction, it is editable" rather than
   inventing its content.

   IT NOW SETS, NOT ONLY QUOTES. This file used to declare itself "deliberately
   NOT a second editor" — pointing at Settings instead. That was reversed on
   purpose: reading the sentence that ruined your image and then being told to go
   find it somewhere else is most of the original complaint, not a fix for it.
   The rule that survives the reversal is the one that mattered in the first
   place: THERE IS STILL ONLY ONE TRUTH. What the box below writes is the GLOBAL
   `identity_prompts.klein_improve` setting — the same value Settings edits, with
   the same "blank = follow the shipped default" contract (shared, not
   re-implemented: PromptOverrideField + promptOverride.js). No per-image
   override, no per-run copy. The panel states its own reach out loud
   (IMPROVE_SCOPE_NOTE), because a control inside a dataset screen reads as
   per-dataset until something says otherwise.

   AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE CACHE THE LOAD-BEARING PART. The 15 s TTL existed
   for a reader; a WRITER turns it into a correctness problem, because this note
   is mounted several times at once and the other copies would keep quoting the
   text the user just replaced — the exact staleness the TTL was added to
   prevent, now caused from inside. So a successful save does not merely
   invalidate the cache: it PUBLISHES the payload the server returned to every
   mounted instance (`subscribers`) and seeds the cache with it. One write, every
   copy correct, and the next mount does not even re-fetch.

   Settings keeps its link: the other identity prompts, the per-subject picker
   and the four strength knobs are not here, and never will be. */
