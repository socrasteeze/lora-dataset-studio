 * exports intentionally keep combine because they are persisted or public. compare tests each
 * selected LoRA ALONE in its column across strengths. combine loads them TOGETHER at individual
 * weights and removes the irrelevant strengths axis from UI/payload. Store weights independently
 * of LoraPicker selection in a dataset_id:checkpoint map so other LoRAs being unchecked/rechecked
