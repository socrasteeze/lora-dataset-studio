 *
 * It used to be shown NOWHERE. People who needed it (to check a file, to point
 * another tool at it) went digging for it in the file manager, and some then
 * pasted it into 🗃 "create a bank" — which registered a bank over the dataset's
 * LIVE files, so that bank's 🗑 Delete rejected deleted images out of the
 * dataset. The app now refuses that paste (backend `services/path_guard.py`),
 * but a refusal is the second line: not making people hunt for the path is the
 * first, and saying whose folder it is right next to it is the second half of
 * the same sentence.
 *
 * Deliberately quiet — one line, monospaced, truncated, with the full path in
 * the title and in the clipboard. At 400 px the path truncates instead of
 * pushing the row sideways. */
