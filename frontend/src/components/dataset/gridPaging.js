/**
 * Client-side paging for the dataset image grid.
 *
 * WHY — the grid used to render EVERY image of the filtered list at once. On a
 * 6 211-image dataset (all kept, all captioned) that is ~148 000 DOM nodes:
 * 6 211 <img>, 6 212 caption <textarea>, ~60 000 buttons, and a page 448 000 px
 * tall. Measured on that dataset, scrolling ran at ~41 ms/frame (~21 fps) while
 * the same build on a 300-image dataset ran at 6 ms/frame (~170 fps) — same
 * code, same machine, same scroll distance, images already cached. Hiding the
 * thumbnails changed nothing (41 → 41 ms) and only 42 of the 6 211 images were
 * ever requested, so `loading="lazy"` was already doing its job: the cost is the
 * NUMBER OF TILES, not the pictures in them.
 *
 * The Bank workspace — the other wall-of-images surface, built for 24 000-image
 * banks — already answers this with pages, so the dataset grid answers it the
 * same way. The difference is only where the slicing happens: the Bank asks the
 * server for a window, while the dataset workspace already holds every row in
 * the payload it polls, so paging here is pure arithmetic and needs no request.
 *
 * Selection deliberately does NOT page. It is a Set of ids owned above this
 * module, so "select all" keeps meaning "every image the current filters show,
 * all pages" (the Bank's own wording) and a selection started on page 3 is still
 * there on page 7. Same for auto-triage, the caption counters and every bulk
 * action: they read the full filtered list, never this slice.
 */

// Tiles here are much heavier than the Bank's (a caption textarea, ✓/✕, four
// action buttons and the badge stack each), but they are also what curation
// works on: too small a page turns "review this dataset" into a clicking chore.
// 500 measured at ~6 ms/frame — same as a small dataset, i.e. the ceiling of
// this machine — so it buys the ergonomics for free.

 * itself instead of showing a dead "1–12 of 12".
