/* Two DELIBERATELY distinct badge families so runs and dataset versions are
   never confused again:

   • RunIdChip — a rounded-full PILL carrying a training run's stable id
     (☁ #49 for a cloud run, 💻 #12 for a local one). This is the identity the
     Runs page and the Checkpoints panel share so "this final" ties back to
     "the run that produced it".
   • DatasetVersionChip — a rounded-RECTANGLE tag for the dataset version the
     run trained on (v1/v2). Different shape + hue = a different notion.

   Both are pure presentational helpers reused by CloudRunsPage and
   TrainingPanel. The pure identity/deep-link helpers live in
   utils/runIdentity.js (framework-free, unit-tested). */

     same number on every surface (it used to wear its cloud id here and its
     record id there, and ⚙ Details on a checkpoints card chased the wrong
     one). The cloud id is context in the tooltip only. A pre-registry cloud
     run has no record: the chip then shows the only number that exists and
