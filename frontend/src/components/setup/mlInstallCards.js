/** The optional ML helpers Setup offers as one-click installs — as DATA.
 *
 * Extracted from SetupPage.jsx for one reason: the capability strips around the
 * app end their "✗ missing" lines with "→ Install … from Setup", and nothing
 * used to guarantee Setup actually OFFERED that install. The video lane shipped
 * whole with both of its extras reachable only through the API — the strip
 * pointed users at a page with no button (found by the first real user, the
 * day the wave landed). JSX does not execute under the bare `node --test`
 * suite, so the promise is only testable if the list lives in a plain module;
 * mlInstallCards.test.js pins every strip hint to a card here.
 *
 * `action` is the backend install action (setup_installer.INSTALL_ACTIONS),
 * `cap` the /api/capabilities key that turns the card's badge green — or an
 * ARRAY of keys when one action installs several pieces that fail apart (the
 * video card ships PyAV *and* a bundled ffmpeg; see cardInstalled below).

    body: 'Isolates the subject from the background for masked training: the surroundings are weighted down so the LoRA binds the identity to the person, not the room. A training without masks is still valid.' },

    body: "Powers the 🗃️ Bank's ✨ Score pass: rates images for aesthetics (1–10), flags NSFW and groups them by visual style with one CLIP pass — and makes 'keep best' prefer the nicest-looking duplicate. Installs into its own Python (CLIP + a small NSFW model). Without it, the Score button is disabled with this hint." },
  { action: 'bank_siglip2', cap: 'bank_siglip2', icon: '🧠',
    title: 'SigLIP 2 semantic engine (optional)',
    body: "Adds Google's general SigLIP2 Base engine as a per-Bank alternative for semantic search, similarity, diversity and crop/variant detection. CLIP remains installed and keeps doing aesthetic, NSFW, style and medium scoring; switching a Bank never deletes either cache. Downloads one pinned Apache-2.0 checkpoint (~1.5 GB) into an LDS-managed Python only when you click Install. If Score uses a GPU Python you already have, that borrowed environment and your Score selection are never changed." },
  // The only card whose install has TWO halves (pip + a ~400 MB model
  // download), which is why its ✓/✗ can disagree with "pip succeeded" and
  // why detailKey points at the server's own explanation rather than a fixed
  // string here.

It never writes captions; the tags live in their own column. Runs fine on CPU. Includes a ~400 MB model download." },
  { action: 'watermark_detect', cap: 'watermark_detect', icon: '🚩',
    title: 'Watermark detector (faster 🚩 Find)',
    body: "Makes the Bank's 🚩 Find watermarks pass roughly ten times faster and lets it run without Ollama: a small classifier scores each image (~0.14 s instead of ~1.7 s asking the vision model in words), and a second model marks where the logo sits so ✂ Crop and 🧽 Inpaint have something to work on. Adds ~0.9 GB of weights into the scoring Python it shares with ✨ Score. Without it nothing breaks — the vision model keeps doing the same job, slower." },

    body: 'Lets the Video bank open your files at all: read their length, size and frame rate, grab thumbnails, measure quality and cut the clips you promote. Two small packages (PyAV + a bundled ffmpeg) into the app\'s own Python — no torch, no GPU. Without it a video bank can list files and nothing more, and every pass names this install as the missing piece.' },
  { action: 'shot_detect', cap: 'video_detect', icon: '🎞️',
    title: 'Shot detection (triage shots, not whole rushes)',
    body: 'Cuts each video at its shot boundaries (TransNetV2) so a two-hour file becomes hundreds of individually reviewable shots. Installs torch (CPU is fine — the network reads 48×27 frames) and one small package into the scoring Python it shares with ✨ Score. Without it you can still watch and triage whole files; you just cannot split them.' },
  { action: 'video_text', cap: 'video_text', icon: '🔳',
    title: 'Burned-in text (🔤 Find text + the 🔳 Safe zone pass)',
    body: 'One OCR engine, two jobs. On Banks and Datasets it powers 🔤 Find text: speech bubbles, subtitles, captions and sound effects become zones 🧽 Repaint can erase. On the Video bank it lets the 🔳 Safe zone pass find subtitles, chyrons and text watermarks and work out how much of each frame a crop would leave you. One small Apache-2.0 package (RapidOCR) into the app\'s own Python — CPU only, no torch, no GPU, and its ~16 MB of weights ride inside the wheel so it works with no internet. Without it the Safe zone pass still measures letterbox bands ("bands only"), and 🔤 Find text stays greyed with this card as the fix.' },
  // This card is the fix for the exact gap the others already closed: the
  // Concept Sources panel (Datasets ▸ Sources) offers the same install action
  // through its own amber banner, but Setup — the screen a new user actually
  // opens first — had no button for it at all, so the "install the scraper
  // extras" advice from that banner led back to a page with nothing to click.

Pexels enumeration works without it (its official API); fetching the actual images still needs curl_cffi. Without it, scraping is limited to sources with no anti-bot layer.' },
