/* Contextual install prompt for face detection (InsightFace), rendered WHERE the
   capability is used rather than in Setup.

   The bug this closes: the capability is named `face_scoring` everywhere, so the
   Mask faces option could only say "install the ML extras (Face-similarity
   scoring) from the Setup tab" — a dead end asking the user to guess that a face
   MASK needs a face SCORER. The install path itself already existed; what was
   missing was declaring the dependency where the decision is made, and making it
   one click.

   Deliberately an OFFER, never a requirement: nothing installs on its own, the
   cost is stated before the click, and declining leaves a fully usable app with
   this one option off. No second installer action is introduced — this reuses
   InstallRunner on the existing `face_scoring` action, so the Setup tile and this
   prompt drive the same queue and the same progress (a install started in either
   place is picked back up by the other on mount).

   Wording/state logic lives in utils/faceDetectionInstall.js so node --test can
   cover it (this file is JSX). */
