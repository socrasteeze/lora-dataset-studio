/* One dropdown of the ◉ LoRA Canvas' filter bar: a chip that says its state,
 * and a popover that holds the controls.
 *
 * ── Why a hand-rolled menu and not <details> ────────────────────────────────
 * `<details>` is what the board's other disclosures use, and it is the right
 * answer for them: they are opened deliberately and closed deliberately. A
 * FILTER is not. You open it, tick two boxes and look at the board — so it has
 * to close when you look away, which `<details>` never does. A summary left
 * open behind the board is a popover permanently covering the thing it filters.
 *
 * Closing is therefore wired to the three gestures that all mean "I am done
 * here": a click outside, Escape, and moving the focus out of the menu. Escape
 * and the focus rule are not decoration — this bar replaced a panel where every
 * checkbox was reachable by Tab, and a menu you can open with a keyboard but
 * not close with one is a worse control than the panel it replaced.
 *
 * ── The chip says the state, closed ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A filter behind a dropdown is a filter you can forget you set — "the board is
 * empty" with no visible cause is the failure mode this whole redesign could
 * have introduced. So the chip carries its own count ("Datasets 3/17") and
 * lights up whenever it is NARROWING anything, at rest, with the popover shut.
