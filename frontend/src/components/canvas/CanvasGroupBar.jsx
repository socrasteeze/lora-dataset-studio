/**
 * 🖼🖼 The title bar of a group of pinned images: its grip, its ✕, its
 * Export grid and its HQ.
 *
 * ── Why this is not inside CanvasImageGroup any more ────────────────────────
 * The bar is drawn ABOVE the strip's box (`top: -barH`), on board space that
 * belongs to no node. Inside the group component it was an ordinary descendant
 * of one absolutely-positioned sibling among many, and `LaneImages` renders
 * those siblings with NO z-index — so any picture the board happened to place
 * over that strip painted on top of the bar and took its pointer events.
 *
 * That is not cosmetic: the bar carries EVERY ONE of a group's affordances, so
 * one picture sitting above a strip left it impossible to move, impossible to
 * export and impossible to close at the same time. Measured on the real DOM: a
 * picture pinned flush above a two-image strip made 5 of 11 points sampled
 * along the bar hand the pointer to the picture.
 *
 * So the bars are drawn as a LAYER, after every picture and every strip — the
 * same answer, and the same `z-` idiom, that the merge hint in `LaneImages`
 * already uses. Chrome wins over content, always; the pictures keep their own
 * paint order among themselves.
 *
 * ── The invariant this file exists to keep ──────────────────────────────────
 * ✕ MUST BE REACHABLE. A node that can be neither moved nor removed is the
 * worst state the board can be in, and closing is the way out of every other
 * one. The render-order contract is asserted in tests/canvas-group-bar.test.mjs.
 *
 * It carries `data-canvas-group` and the same `data-dataset-id`/`data-anchor-id`
 * as the strip, because the frame's pointer handler reads the gesture's target
 * off exactly those — the bar moves the ANCHOR, whose box IS the strip's.

          Every picture on this board is a WebP tile, and each one already
          carries its own HQ. That is the right control for one picture and the
          wrong one for eight: comparing a face across a strip meant eight
          clicks on eight buttons that are counter-scaled to the size of a
          fingernail at Fit zoom. So the strip gets a master toggle, in the bar
          that already owns everything a group does as a whole.
          It OVERRIDES the members rather than writing to them: switching it off
          gives each picture back the HQ choice it had, instead of quietly
          undoing the two you had turned on by hand.
          Not persisted, exactly like the per-picture one — it is a look you
          take, not a property of the board; a board reopened tomorrow is cheap
          again. */}
