/* 📊 How hard the machine is working, on the board that is working it.
 *
 * The Canvas is where runs are launched and pictures are generated, and the
 * question it could not answer was the simplest one: "is anything HAPPENING?".
 * A run that is queued, a run that is training and a run that is wedged all
 * look identical from here. Four numbers settle it at a glance — and a glance
 * is exactly the budget: one 11-px line in the toolbar the board already has,
 * not a dashboard, not a graph, not a second page.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, on purpose:
 *  • no history, no sparkline. A curve invites you to watch it; this is meant
 *    to be read in half a second and forgotten.
 *  • no per-process breakdown. "Which of these is ComfyUI?" is a Task Manager
 *    question and pretending to answer it here would need a far more expensive
 *    probe on every poll.
 *  • no alerting. Numbers are emerald below 50 %, amber 50-80 % and rose past
 *    80 % of a resource, and that is the entire vocabulary.
 *
 * COST. Three deliberate limits, because this is the only thing on the page
 * that polls forever:
 *  • only while the tab is VISIBLE (Page Visibility). A canvas left open
 *    overnight in a background tab would otherwise ask ~17 000 times.
 *  • only while it is unfolded — the ▾ toggle stops the timer, it does not
 *    just hide the line, and the choice is remembered.
 *  • `background: true`, so a poll that fails while the server restarts never
 *    raises the "connection lost" toast. A load readout is not worth an alarm;
 *    it just stops updating until the next poll succeeds.
 *
 * 📱 Below `sm` the whole thing is `hidden`. The board's toolbar already wraps
 * into two rows on a 400-px screen and every pixel spent there is a pixel of
 * board under the fold — and the phone is precisely the device where you are
 * NOT the one driving the GPU.
