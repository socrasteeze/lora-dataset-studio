/* 🎨 The board's own generation bar: what is being rendered, and where it went.

   It answers two things that were genuinely missing, both reported from real
   use. "If I leave this page I cannot get back to it" — the progress lives on
   the BOARD now, not inside the settings panel, so it is here whether that panel
   is open, closed, or was never reopened after a reload. And "once the image is
   generated I cannot see where it appears" — a launch that ends in silence is a
   launch you cannot trust, so the finished run names the checkpoints it filled
   and each one opens its gallery in a click.

   The vocabulary is the Test Studio's, word for word ("N generating · M queued",
   "Stop (resumable)"): it is the same engine, and inventing a second wording for
   one run would read as a second feature.

   400 px is the design target, not the fallback: the row wraps, the result
   buttons wrap under it, and nothing here is ever the reason the page scrolls
   sideways. */
