/* Which datasets — and which runs of them — sit on the board.
 *
 * ── What this replaced, and why ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This was a PANEL: a fold-out card holding a search row, a status row, a model
 * row and a three-column checkbox list, one line per dataset. Measured on a
 * real library of fourteen datasets at 1280×720 it stood 389 px tall — 54 % of
 * the viewport — sitting directly above the board, on every load, for anyone
 * who had ever left it unfolded. The board, which is the entire point of the
 * page, got what was left. Folding it was possible and was the answer nobody
 * used, because a filter you have to fold away before you can work is a filter
 * that is in the way.
 *
 * It is now a BAR: one wrapping row of chips, ~40 px tall, each opening a
 * popover with the controls that used to be spread across the panel. Nothing
 * was dropped — multi-select, per-dataset run counts, Select all / Clear, the
 * board search, the status and model filters, the pinned-images toggle and
 * Reset are all still here, one click deeper and none of them costing height
 * while unused.
 *
 * ── The two rules a bar has to obey that a panel did not ────────────────────
 *   • A FILTER YOU CANNOT SEE MUST STILL ANNOUNCE ITSELF. Behind a dropdown,
 *     "the board is empty" with no visible cause is a real failure mode, and it
 *     is the one this redesign could have introduced. Every chip therefore
 *     carries its own count at rest and lights up while it is narrowing
 *     anything, and the bar keeps the "N runs shown" readout it always had.
 *   • THE POPOVERS MUST WIN over the board. The section owns a stacking context
 *     (`relative isolate z-20`) and the board frame owns its own — so nothing
 *     drawn on the board, at any z-index, can paint over an open filter.
 *
 * The `lds.canvasFilterOpen` key that remembered the old fold is deliberately
 * left alone rather than deleted: it is stored in real browsers, the helpers
 * that read it are still exported and tested, and a bar has no fold for it to
 * mean anything about. It simply stops being consulted.

             From `lg` up it is exactly what it always was: a text field in the

             and burying a text field one click deep costs more than the 12 rem it
             occupies.

             📱 Below `lg` that arithmetic flips. Measured at 400×800: the field
             is 224 px of a 360-px row, which is what pushed the bar from two
             wrapped rows to three — 46 px of board, above the board, on every
             load, for a control that is empty on all but a handful of visits. So
             it collapses behind 🔍 and unfolds onto a row of its own when asked
             for, keeping its full width when it IS being used.

             It obeys the bar's own rule about hidden filters: with a query set
             and the field folded away, the 🔍 chip lights up and carries the
             query in its title, so "the board is filtered" is never a fact you
             have to go looking for. Folding it away also CLEARS nothing — the
