/* 🪪 The dataset's reference face, on the ◉ LoRA Canvas.

   The board's whole job is judging whether a checkpoint got the likeness right,
   and it showed every render and never the person — so the comparison happened
   from memory. The reference now opens each lane's header.

   Pinned as a SOURCE contract because `node --test` cannot parse JSX: the parts
   that would silently disappear in a rewrite are the gate (a concept or a style
   dataset has no reference face and must not be shown an empty frame), the URL
   shape, and the fact that the lane is actually handed the two fields. None of
   those throws when it breaks. */
