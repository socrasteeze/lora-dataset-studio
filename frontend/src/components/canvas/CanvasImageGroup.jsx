/* Several pinned images fused into ONE node: a continuous strip, side by
   side, with nothing drawn between them.

   Drop one pinned picture onto another and they merge; drop a third, a tenth,
   there is no limit. Drag one off the strip and it is a node of its own again.

   ── What this component is NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   It is not a container that owns its pictures. Each member is still the very
   same CanvasImageNode, with its own , its own ✕ and whatever the chrome
   gains next — only its frame, its resize corner and its permanent header are
   dropped, and its box comes from the strip instead of from itself (see
   utils/canvasImageGroups). A group that swallowed its members would have had
   to re-invent every one of their actions and answer "which one am I closing?"
   from scratch. Here the answer is the ordinary one: the picture you are
   pointing at lights up and shows its own buttons.

   ── The two gestures, and why they cannot be confused ───────────────────────
   Dragging a picture and dragging the node it is in are the same physical
   gesture, so they are given different GRIPS:

     • the title bar moves the whole strip. It is the only thing that does, it
       is visible at rest, it says how many pictures are here, and it carries
       the group's ✕;
     • dragging a picture INSIDE the strip means "take this one out", and it
       only takes effect once the pointer is off the strip — which is exactly
       the way it was asked for ("je la drague en dehors du node"), and the only
       rule that explains itself while you are performing it. Let go while still
       over the strip and nothing happened.

   The bar's height is counter-scaled by the board zoom (canvasNodeChrome.
   groupBarHeight): a grip four pixels tall at 24 % would not make the gesture
   awkward, it would make the group immovable — the same bug the ✕ already had
   once on a phone.

   ⚠ Width grows without limit, on purpose. Ten pictures side by side is ten
   times as wide, and this is a board that zooms and pans, so ✦ Fit is the
   answer rather than a silent wrap onto a second row — a strip that quietly
   stopped being a strip at some threshold nobody can see would be worse than a
   wide one. */
