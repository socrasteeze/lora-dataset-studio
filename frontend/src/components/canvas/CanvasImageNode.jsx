/* One generated image, pinned ON the board.

   The board compares checkpoints and the thing being compared is the picture —
   so a picture that can only be seen one at a time, in a modal, cannot be
   compared at all. Pinned, it becomes a node like any other: draggable,
   resizable, joined by an edge to the checkpoint pill that produced it (that
   edge is drawn by the lane, with the SAME connector a continuation uses — see
   utils/canvasImageNodes.imageNodeEdges).

   Closing is a ✕ on the node and it does NOT forget anything: the geometry is
   kept and re-opening the same image from its gallery puts it back exactly
   here, at exactly this size. That is the feature; the storage side of it is
   `visible: false` on the canvas_image_node row.

   ⚠ Touch. Dragging a node and panning the board are the same physical
   gesture, and this file inherits the board's answer to that (LineageCanvas):
   with a mouse the press hit-tests onto the node and moves it; with a finger
   the board pans until a LONG PRESS picks the node up. The resize corner is the
   exception — it is hit-tested first on any pointer type, because a finger that
   lands on a 28-px corner handle can only mean one thing.

   ⚠ …and the size of those controls is NOT a board size. Reported from a phone:
   "the cross does not close the preview". The handler was right — the board has
   always refused to start a gesture from a node's own button — but the button
   itself was ~16 board units on a board read at 65 %, so about ten pixels under
   a finger, with the immediately beside it. The controls are therefore
   counter-scaled by the board zoom (utils/canvasNodeChrome.chromeScale) so they
   keep a constant size on screen, and they are laid out as one cluster in the
   corner rather than two glyphs crammed into a 12-px header row.

   ⌨ Keyboard. The node itself is focusable: arrows move it, Shift+arrows move
   it faster, +/− resize it, Esc closes it. Moving and resizing by mouse alone
   would put the whole feature out of reach of anyone who does not use one. The
   arithmetic is nudgeImageNode(), unit-tested; this file only routes keys. */
