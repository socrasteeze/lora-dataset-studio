/* 🖼 One generated image, pinned ON the board.

   The board compares checkpoints and the thing being compared is the picture —
   so a picture that can only be seen one at a time, in a modal, cannot be
   compared at all. Pinned, it becomes a node like any other: draggable,
   resizable, joined by an edge to the checkpoint pill that produced it (that
   edge is drawn by the lane, with the SAME connector a continuation uses — see
   utils/canvasImageNodes.imageNodeEdges).

   Closing is a ✕ on the node and it does NOT forget anything: the geometry is
   kept and re-opening the same image from its gallery puts it back exactly
   here, at exactly this size. That is the feature; the storage side of it is
   `visible: false` on the canvas_image_node row.

   ⚠ Touch. Dragging a node and panning the board are the same physical
   gesture, and this file inherits the board's answer to that (LineageCanvas):
   with a mouse the press hit-tests onto the node and moves it; with a finger
   the board pans until a LONG PRESS picks the node up. The resize corner is the
   exception — it is hit-tested first on any pointer type, because a finger that
   lands on a 28-px corner handle can only mean one thing.

   ⚠ …and the size of those controls is NOT a board size. Reported from a phone:
   "the cross does not close the preview". The handler was right — the board has
   always refused to start a gesture from a node's own button — but the button
   itself was ~16 board units on a board read at 65 %, so about ten pixels under
   a finger, with the ⛶ immediately beside it. The controls are therefore
   counter-scaled by the board zoom (utils/canvasNodeChrome.chromeScale) so they
   keep a constant size on screen, and they are laid out as one row along an
   EDGE rather than two glyphs crammed into a 12-px header row.

   ⚠️ …and that row is one LINE, in the bottom-right corner. It wrapped into two
   columns for a while, on the reasoning that a wider row spends more of the cap
   that keeps the controls off the picture, so every target shrinks. True — and
   wrong about what a control must never do. Four controls in two columns is not
   a cluster in a corner, it is a 2×2 block: 70 % of the tile wide and two rows
   tall, it landed in the middle of the picture it decorates and covered the
   "step N · strength X" label sitting beside it, so it hid both of the things
   the board exists to compare. One line along the bottom edge costs each target
   some size at extreme zoom-out (the number is pinned in canvasNodeChrome.test)
   and gives the picture back at every zoom.

   Bottom-right, not top-right, and the gallery already settled that: its 📌 sits
   bottom-right precisely because the top corners belong to what LABELS a tile
   (the 👍/👎 verdict there, the step/strength label here). Actions and labels do
   not share a corner. The row keeps clear of the resize corner by reserving it,
   which is why chromeScale is told about it — and "which corner" is a question
   with two answers, which is the bug that followed: a group MEMBER draws no
   handle of its own, so it reserved nothing, but the STRIP draws one at its
   bottom-right and that is the LAST member's bottom-right. An armed 🗑 sat on
   the group's only size grip. Both the drawing and the reserving now read
   canvasNodeChrome.hasOwnResizeCorner / groupCornerUnits.

   HQ. Every picture here is a WebP tile (utils/datasetThumbUrl) because a board
   of forty full-resolution PNGs is tens of megabytes; HQ swaps THIS one for the
   original file, in place, and lights up while it is on. Per node and not
   persisted: it is a look you take at one picture, not a property of the board.

   What ⬇ downloads keeps its lineage in its NAME — dataset, run, step, seed —
   because this board is the only place that knows all four and a file called
   out_00042_.png in Downloads knows none of them.

   ⌨ Keyboard. The node itself is focusable: arrows move it, Shift+arrows move
   it faster, +/− resize it, Esc closes it. Moving and resizing by mouse alone
   would put the whole feature out of reach of anyone who does not use one. The
   arithmetic is nudgeImageNode(), unit-tested; this file only routes keys. */

     checkpoints on skin or on fine text is exactly where a lossy tile is not
     good enough. So the original bytes are one button away, per picture.
     Deliberately NOT persisted and not a board-wide setting: it is a look, not

   `onGeometry` are useCallback'd by the board, and `blendNote` resolves to a
