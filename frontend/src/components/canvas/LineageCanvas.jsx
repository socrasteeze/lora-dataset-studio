/* ◉ The LoRA Canvas surface — every selected dataset's genealogy on ONE board,
   with zoom and pan.

   It draws with the SAME card, pill and edge components as the graph embedded in
   a run's card (components/dataset/lineageNodes + lineageEdges); the geometry of
   each dataset's tree is still utils/lineageGraph.js. What is new here is only
   the surface: several trees stacked into lanes, and a viewport you can move.

   Slice 2 added direct manipulation: cards can be dragged, and where they land
   is remembered (utils/canvasPlacement.js + the canvas_node_position table).

   Slice 3 makes the board GENERATE. Ticking a pill adds that checkpoint to a
   run; picks may come from several lanes at once, which is the whole reason the
   board holds every dataset. The settings are not a canvas invention — the
   panel is the Test Studio's own RunSetupPanel on the Test Studio's own hooks
   (see hooks/useCanvasStudio), so the two screens are one implementation. Each
   pill also carries a × N badge opening the gallery of everything that
   checkpoint ever produced.

   Gestures: wheel (or trackpad pinch, which arrives as ctrl+wheel) zooms around
   the pointer; dragging the background pans; two fingers pinch-zoom; dragging a
   card moves it.

   ⚠ Moving a card and moving the view are the SAME physical gesture. With a
   mouse, hit-testing settles it: the press either landed on a card or it did
   not. On touch there is nothing to hit-test with — a finger on a card could
   mean either — so the finger PANS by default and only starts moving the card
   after a long press, which is the gesture every touch UI already uses for
   "pick this up". Moving before the press completes cancels it, so a flick that
   happens to start on a card still scrolls the board. */

   retargets every click that follows to the frame itself — so an onDoubleClick
   written on the edge is a handler that can never fire. That is the same trap

  /* 📱 ⋯ — the toolbar's second shelf, and the actual answer to "there is no
     room to work on this board".

     Measured at 412x780 and again at 904x750 (a phone, and a Fold opened): the
     bottom bar wrapped to TWO rows and the filter bar above it to two more, so
     232 px of a 780-px screen were chrome FLOATING ON the board — more than the
     board had left between them. Shrinking the buttons had already been tried
     (40-px targets, labels dropped at `sm`); it bought one row back and then ran
     out, because the row was never RANKED. Everything on it was equally
     important, so everything stayed on it, so it wrapped.

     The rank the bar carries now, every threshold of it measured on a real
     board rather than chosen:
       - always inline: zoom, Fit, 🎨 Generate, ⋯ — the ones you reach for while
         reading the board, and the only ones it cannot be used without;
       - `lg` and up inline, in ⋯ below: ✦ Tidy up, 💾 Layouts, 📷 PNG, 🔌 +LoRA
         — real actions, taken a handful of times per session, not per minute.
         Measured: inline at 768 they take the bar to two rows, at 1024 they fit
         on one, so the threshold is 1024 and not "md, that sounds about right";
       - `2xl` and up inline, in ⋯ below: the colour key and CPU/GPU/VRAM.
         READOUTS — nothing here is a control, and a whole row of a phone was
         going to "GPU 0 %";
       - in ⋯ at EVERY width: the gesture line. It is ~500 characters, so it has
         never fitted beside anything: measured with it inline the bar is two
         rows at 1440 AND at 1920, which is where the desktop bar's second row
         had been coming from all along. It is the board's documentation, read
         once and then never again — the last thing that should be costing the
         board a permanent row.
     Three tiers and not one because they are three different questions: an
     action behind ⋯ costs a tap, a readout behind ⋯ costs nothing until asked
     for, and a manual behind ⋯ costs a tap as well — it is FOLDED inside the
     sheet, not printed in it. Read "costs nothing at all" here once, and it was
     wrong: unfolded, the sentence is ten lines at 400 px, so opening ⋯ for a
     button buried the button under the manual. Being one box further out than
     the toolbar it no longer grew the BAR, which is what the previous pass was
     measuring — and is why the regression looked like a fix.

     Each control is rendered EXACTLY ONCE — inline or in the sheet, never both

     340 px of the second is what made the shelf unusable on a phone.

     Deliberately NOT reset when the shelf closes. The bubble is opened from
     inside the shelf and then read AGAINST the board — closing ⋯ to see what

          Every control below used to be stacked ABOVE the frame: the zoom row,
          the colour key, the gestures sheet, the run tracker, the dataset filter.
          Measured at 400 px that chrome cost ~290 px before a single card was
          drawn, which is why the frame was pinned to 60vh — and on a phone the
          board opened at 10% zoom under a wall of buttons. Stacking chrome above
          a canvas spends the one thing a canvas is for.
      
          So they are SIBLINGS of the frame, absolutely placed over it, and the
          frame takes the height they gave back. Siblings, not children, and that
          is the load-bearing part: the frame owns the pan/zoom pointer handlers
          and `touch-none`, so a button nested inside it would hand every tap to
          the board underneath. The wrapper is `pointer-events-none` and only the
          controls themselves take the pointer, so the board stays draggable
          through the gaps between them. */}

        // half the board blue.
        /* 📐 THE FRAME IS FIXED, AND IT IS ALL THE ROOM THERE IS. No `vh`
           fraction and no content-derived height any more: `flex-1 min-h-0`
           inside a column that is exactly one viewport tall (see App.jsx's
           `/canvas` shell and CanvasPage's root), so the board takes every
           pixel left under the app header, the page title and whatever banner
           happens to be up — and not one pixel more, so the PAGE never scrolls.

           Both of the heights this replaces were wrong in the same way, from
           opposite ends. A fixed 72vh/76vh left a strip of dead page under the
           board on a desktop. Sizing the frame to the CONTENT (a clamp around
           the board's own preferred height, which shipped for one day) then made
           the frame elastic: ✦ Tidy up compacted the board and the frame collapsed
           around it mid-view, cutting cards off at the current zoom, and
           dragging a node downwards inflated the frame live under the hand. A
           canvas whose own edges move while you work it is unreadable. The
           board's size is answered by ZOOM (✦ Fit, the +/− buttons, the wheel),

           A stacking context of its own means nothing drawn inside the frame,
           at any z-index, can paint over a sibling overlay: two independent
           guarantees instead of one, for the controls the user cannot afford to

            and a scroll container clips its children: the Datasets menu opened
            354 px tall inside a 76-px box and the user saw a 20-px sliver of
            it. The reason for the clip left with the panel; the clip had to go
            with it. Nothing replaced it, because there is nothing left here
            that can grow — measured at 400 px the chips wrap to two rows, and
            the search field, which was the third, unfolds only when asked. */}

              strip runs over the filter".

              The board could never paint over this row — the frame clips
              (`overflow-hidden`) and owns its own stacking context, so no
              z-index inside it can reach a sibling overlay, and two passes of
              z-index work went into proving that. The symptom kept coming back
              anyway, because it was never a z-order bug: the chips are
              `bg-app/60`, Reset and the runs readout have no fill at all, and
              between and behind them the row was simply TRANSPARENT. A group of
              pinned images parked in the top-right corner was legible straight
              through it, which reads as a strip lying on top of Reset — and no
              amount of z-index can fix something that is already underneath.

              So the top chrome gets what the bottom toolbar has had all along:
              an opaque pill. Same tokens, deliberately — the two bars are the
              same kind of object and were never meant to be one solid and one

              "N generating · M queued · Stop (resumable)" twice, ~70 px each,
              stacked at the two ends of a 800-px screen.

            The COLUMN is what makes the ceiling work without arithmetic: the
            bubble is the only shrinkable child (`min-h-0`), so flexbox hands it
            whatever is left after the shelf and the bar have taken their
            height — at any shelf height, on any screen. A `max-h` in rem would

              whole difference between tools you can call up and tools that have
              taken the screen. (Learnt the hard way once already: the gesture
              help used to be a `<details>` INSIDE the pill, and an open
