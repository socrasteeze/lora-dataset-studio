/* ◉ The LoRA Canvas surface — every selected dataset's genealogy on ONE board,
   with zoom and pan.

   It draws with the SAME card, pill and edge components as the graph embedded in
   a run's card (components/dataset/lineageNodes + lineageEdges); the geometry of
   each dataset's tree is still utils/lineageGraph.js. What is new here is only
   the surface: several trees stacked into lanes, and a viewport you can move.

   Slice 2 added direct manipulation: cards can be dragged, and where they land
   is remembered (utils/canvasPlacement.js + the canvas_node_position table).

   Slice 3 makes the board GENERATE. Ticking a pill adds that checkpoint to a
   run; picks may come from several lanes at once, which is the whole reason the
   board holds every dataset. The settings are not a canvas invention — the
   panel is the Test Studio's own RunSetupPanel on the Test Studio's own hooks
   (see hooks/useCanvasStudio), so the two screens are one implementation. Each
   pill also carries a × N badge opening the gallery of everything that
   checkpoint ever produced.

   Gestures: wheel (or trackpad pinch, which arrives as ctrl+wheel) zooms around
   the pointer; dragging the background pans; two fingers pinch-zoom; dragging a
   card moves it.

   ⚠ Moving a card and moving the view are the SAME physical gesture. With a
   mouse, hit-testing settles it: the press either landed on a card or it did
   not. On touch there is nothing to hit-test with — a finger on a card could
   mean either — so the finger PANS by default and only starts moving the card
   after a long press, which is the gesture every touch UI already uses for
   "pick this up". Moving before the press completes cancels it, so a flick that
   happens to start on a card still scrolls the board. */

const ZOOM_STEP = 1.25;
// How long a finger must rest on a card before it picks it up. Long enough not
// to fire on a flick that starts on a card, short enough not to feel broken.
const LONG_PRESS_MS = 420;
// Screen pixels of travel before a press counts as a drag. Below it the gesture
// is still a click, so inspecting a run never depends on holding perfectly
// still — and a 2-px twitch must not write a position to the database.
const DRAG_SLOP = 4;

/* What the board can be told to do, written ONCE.
   The toolbar shows it inline from `lg` up and behind a one-tap ☝ Gestures
   disclosure below that. Two copies of this sentence would have drifted the
   first time a gesture was added, and it is the only documentation the board
   has. The touch half is named explicitly (pinch, long-press) because the
   device that most needs this list is the one with no wheel and no hover. */

          It is a full-screen modal, NOT more rows inside the popover, and that

          fit a 400-px phone, and the launch form has a lane picker, a
          checkpoint select, a step field and five folded settings. Cramming it
          in would have produced a third, smaller, diverging form — the exact
          debt the shared popover was extracted to avoid. The popover stays what
          it is good at: the launcher.

          It is also drawn in SCREEN pixels (fixed inset-0), like the popover
          above it — neither scales with the board. A control drawn in world
          units becomes a ~6-px target at 45 % zoom, which is how the ✕ became
          unclickable once already. */}
