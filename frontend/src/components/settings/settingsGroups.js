/* The collapsible GROUPS a long settings section is organised into, and the
 * little state around them. PURE JS — `node --test` covers every decision.
 *
 * WHY GROUPS AND NOT SUB-PAGES. The Image engines section had grown into a
 * single wall of eleven cards — API keys next to Klein pins next to LoRA
 * presets next to the improve prompt — and "where is the thing I came for"
 * was answered by scrolling (reported from a tablet, mid preset editing).
 * Groups keep every deep-link alive for free: each group is a NATIVE
 * <details>, and help/revealTarget.openCollapsedAncestors already opens a
 * collapsed <details> on the way to a ?focus= field — so Settings search and
 * every "Open in Settings →" link land INSIDE the right group with zero new
 * wiring. Sub-pages would have needed an alias for every existing link.
 *
 * The <details> stay UNCONTROLLED on purpose: the reveal helper flips
 * `open` on the DOM node directly, and a React-controlled `open` prop would
 * fight it on the next render. The initial state is read once at mount; the
 * prop value then never changes, so React never writes over a user's toggle.
