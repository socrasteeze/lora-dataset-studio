/* 🖼 Everything one checkpoint — or one whole RUN — ever produced.

   Images used to be attached to a checkpoint by PARSING the LoRA's filename on
   every render, and a checkpoint could hold exactly one preview — regenerating
   replaced it. Both are gone: the link is a pair of columns written when the
   image is generated, and previews accumulate. So a pill can now open a real
   history, whatever produced it — an inline canvas preview, a Test-Studio grid
   cell, a comparison run.

   ONE panel, two scopes. A click on a run CARD opens the same component with a
   `{kind:'run'}` target: every step of that run at once, grouped, plus the run's
   notes and the settings it trained with. A second panel for the run scope would
   have been two grids over the same rows, two Select modes and two places to
   keep the delete's promises true — agreeing on the day they shipped and
   drifting on the first change. Which endpoints, which title and how the groups
   are laid out all come from utils/runGallery (pure, unit-tested).

   Volume is handled, not hoped for. A run with fourteen checkpoints answers a
   payload capped per step AND overall, the panel opens the three most-trained
   groups and folds the rest behind their counts, and every cut is stated: a
   capped gallery that looks complete lies about the run.

   `unlinked` is stated, not hidden. Images generated before the columns existed,
   whose filename carries no run tag, cannot be attributed without guessing — so
   they are not shown under one, and the panel says how many there are. An
   incomplete history that says so beats a tidy one that lies. Images whose name
   names a RUN but no step are no longer part of that number: they are a real
   "Step unknown" group, because the run genuinely is known.

   🗑 And it deletes. A checkpoint accumulates dozens of renders and most are
   misses; a gallery that can only show them makes the user leave the board to
   clean up. The delete is REAL (the row is the Test Studio's own cell — see
   galleryDeleteConfirmation for the sentences that say so before the click) and
   the file goes to the recycle bin / the app Trash rather than being destroyed.
   The run scope deletes through the SAME backend function with a wider filter,
   so nothing about that promise is maintained twice.

   Deletion is deliberately UNREACHABLE by accident: it needs Select mode, then a
   pick, then a confirmation. Tapping a tile while scrolling a phone grid can
   never delete anything — outside Select mode a tap only zooms. Select now opens
   that mode from the same pinned bar the rest of it lives in (it used to sit in
   the header, a reach away from everything it leads to) — from the OPPOSITE end
   of that bar, and Delete stays disabled until a tile is picked, so sharing a
   row with the destructive button costs the guard nothing. */
