/* A model-file setting, editable from the WORK SCREEN, saving the very same
   global key Settings shows.
 *
 * WHY IT IS GLOBAL, STATED PLAINLY. There is one value per engine, not one per
 * dataset: whichever screen you change it from, you change it for every future
 * run. That is the decision, and this component's whole job is to make it
 * legible — a control that changes more than the batch in front of you has to
 * say so, which is the rule the four Krea dials in this same panel already
 * follow (`⚠ These four save straight to your settings`).
 *
 * NOTHING NEW IS COMPOSED HERE. The combobox is `settings/ModelFilePicker`, the
 * list is its `useModelFiles` hook against `/api/comfy/model-files`, and the
 * write is the same `PUT /api/settings` patch the dials use. Same widget, same
 * scan, same key, same endpoint — so "the setting in the dataset and the setting
 * in Settings are exactly the same one" is true by construction rather than by
 * two implementations agreeing.
