/* Source-as-text contract for the 🧽 Klein clean's three dials.
 *
 * Bank and Dataset are two surfaces of one product (CLAUDE.md): a user who finds the
 * prompt box on one expects it on the other and files a bug when it is missing — and
 * "full parity, always" covers the DIALS, not only the pass underneath. The 🔤 Find
 * text sample dial already shipped bank-only with a written reason, and the reason did
 * not survive a day. So the mount is asserted on both, from the source, rather than
 * trusted to whoever ports the next change.
 *
 * Text assertions, not a render: these components pull the whole workspace tree in, and
 * a JSX runtime is not part of `node --test` here. What that buys is real (a deleted
 * mount fails this); what it cannot see is whether the panel is reachable on screen,
 * which is what the headless capture in the delivery covers. */
