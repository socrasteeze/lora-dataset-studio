/* 🔍 ONE generated image, large, with what it was made from.

   It replaces two things: the zoom that lived inline in CheckpointGalleryPanel,
   and PreviewLightbox (which now renders this with the little it knows). The
   app already carries DatasetLightbox and BankReviewLightbox and neither could
   be reused here — DatasetLightbox is about a DATASET image (crop, mirror,
   Klein improve, Pexels attribution, a `filename` on a dataset route) and
   BankReviewLightbox is a triage queue with keep/reject/skip and its own
   session. Both are the wrong nouns and the wrong verbs. So this is not a
   fourth viewer: it is the third, and it absorbs the inline one that made four.

   ⚠ What was wrong with the old one, because it is the whole reason this file
   exists. Under the image sat a single paragraph:

     step 2500 · seed 208607443 · strength 0 · <forty lines of prompt>

   — the three facts you are actually looking for buried at the head of a wall of
   text, set across the full width of a 2 000-px screen. Three fixes, all
   structural:

     1. HIERARCHY. The facts are not the same kind of thing as the prompt. Step,
        seed and strength are chips; the settings that decided the picture are a
        table; the prose is last.
     2. BOUNDED READING WIDTH. Above `md` the metadata is a column beside the
        image, not a line under it, so it can never run wider than a paragraph —
        and the image takes the whole height it leaves. See
        generatedImageLightboxLayout.js for why that split starts at `md` and
        not, as it first did, at `lg`.
     3. THE PROMPT FOLDS. Long by nature, it opens collapsed past a threshold
        and scrolls rather than pushing everything else off the screen.

   And the seed and the prompt COPY in one click, because that is what those two
   values are for — you re-play a seed, you re-use a prompt.

   Everything the panel decides (which facts, in which order, what folds) is in
   utils/generatedImageFacts.js, where `node --test` can reach it. */
