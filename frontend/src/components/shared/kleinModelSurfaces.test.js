/** Every screen that STARTS Klein work names the model it will run on.
 *
 * The reported gap was two questions in one, and only the first got answered
 * first: "let me choose the model" (a dataset setting) and "tell me which model
 * is running" (a line of text). The second is the half that works everywhere —
 * on a one-model install, and on the bank, which has no dataset to choose with.
 *
 * Three lanes were still silent after the choice shipped: the local reference
 * edit, the rescue of scraped images under 768 px, and the watermark inpaint
 * (dataset AND bank). They render the shared <KleinModelSetting> now, and this
 * pins it: a surface that drops the component fails here rather than quietly
 * going back to running an unnamed model. `node --test` cannot parse JSX, so
 * the assertion is textual — the same technique as SettingsLink.test.js.
