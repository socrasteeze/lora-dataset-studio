/* WHAT EACH BANK PASS IS, told in the three blocks its launch window shows.
 *
 * WHY THREE BLOCKS AND NOT ONE "SETTINGS" PANEL. A window called "settings for
 * this pass" would be a lie, and it was measured: of the 12 knobs in 🎚 Filter
 * thresholds, the 🔎 Scan quality pass reads exactly ONE (dup_distance) — its
 * measuring code (services/image_quality.py) does not even import the config.
 * The other eleven decide how the GRID IS SORTED AND FLAGGED, and they re-sort on
 * save without any pass running. Mixing the two in one window would teach people
 * that nudging a slider costs a rescan, which is the opposite of true.
 *
 * So every window says three separate things:
 *   THIS RUN                 — where it runs and how big that is (the scope).
 *   SETTINGS THIS PASS READS — only what the CALCULATION consumes, and where
 *                              those values live (they are global — the same for
 *                              every bank — unless said otherwise).
 *   NOT DECIDED HERE         — what is re-read when the grid is sorted or
 *                              flagged, retunable with no pass at all.
 *
 * AND A FOURTH THING WHEN IT IS TRUE: `caveats`, for what the scope does NOT
 * cover. 🔎 Scan's duplicate re-grouping always covers the whole bank whatever
 * the scope; 🎨 Medium also runs chained inside ✨ Score with the default scope.
 * Both are stated rather than left for someone to discover.
 *
 * SCOPES THAT WOULD LIE ARE OFFERED DISABLED, WITH THE REASON. ✨ Score, 👥 Group
 * by person and ✂ Find crops & variants each produce a PARTITION of the whole
 * bank, renumbered on every run: handed a subset they would number a
 * sub-population from 1 and drop those ids on top of unrelated groups already in
 * the database. A wrong group is worse than a missing option — but a missing
 * option is worse than a disabled one, because the maintainer concluded a shipped
 * feature did not exist twice over from exactly that kind of silence.
 *
 * Plain .js (no JSX) so `node --test` can execute all of it.
