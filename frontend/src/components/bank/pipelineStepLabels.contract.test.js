/* THE GUARD FOR A DEFECT THAT SHIPPED TWICE AND WAS NEVER SEEN.
 *
 * The Launch-all report renders `STEP_LABEL[s.step] || s.step`. That fallback is
 * the whole problem: a step added to PIPELINE_STEPS without a label does not
 * break anything, it just prints its own internal identifier and looks like a
 * feature nobody named. Two of the eight steps lived that way — `semantic_dedup`
 * and `framing` — until the maintainer read his own report and reported that he
 * "didn't really know what semantic_dedup was". He did: it is the ✂ button in the
 * pass row. The report was speaking a different language from the buttons.
 *
 * So this test reads the SERVER's tuple, not a copy of it. A copy would have to be
 * kept in sync by the same person who forgot the label, which is no guard at all.
