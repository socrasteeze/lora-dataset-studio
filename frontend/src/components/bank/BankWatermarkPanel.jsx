/**
 * 🚩 Watermark cleaning — the Bank's two-level escalation, launched by hand.
 *
 * A bank points at a folder that belongs to the user and we NEVER write to it,
 * so a cleaned image is a separate copy kept by the app; the original stays on
 * disk untouched. That is what lets both levels be tried freely: ↩ Undo just
 * throws our copy away.
 *
 * Level 1 (🚩 Find) records WHERE each mark sits — the two below route on it.
 * Level 2 (✂ Auto-crop) cuts off marks sitting in a border — no model, no GPU,
 * and it invents no pixel. Level 3 (🧽 Inpaint) repaints whatever level 2 could
 * not handle, with LaMa (fast) or Klein (slower, also handles marks ON the
 * subject). Each level shows its own remaining/handled counts, because the whole
 * point is to see how far down the funnel the bank already is.
 *
 * LEVELS 2 AND 3 OPEN A LAUNCH WINDOW, like every other pass. They were the last
 * two actions on this page that fired straight from the click, and they are the
 * only two that produce new image files: a real bank offered "✂ Auto-crop
 * (16 052)" and "🧽 Inpaint (16 507)" with no way to say which images. The window
 * carries the kept / undecided / unkept / all scope, the selection, the measured
 * count per line — and, because these two write files, what ↩ Undo really takes
 * back and what it does not.
 *
 * All of the "which button is live, and why not" logic lives in the JSX-free
 * `bankWatermark.js` so `node --test` covers it; this file is the shell.
