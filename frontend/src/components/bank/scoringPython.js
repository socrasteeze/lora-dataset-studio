 * costs hours. The fix is NOT to download a 2.5 GB CUDA wheel from inside the
 * app (wrong wheel index = a broken environment, and it is a big download for
 * people who may not need it). It is to reuse an interpreter this machine has
 * already proven — the one ComfyUI runs on, the one that trains LoRAs.
 *
 * The whole value is in being specific. "ai-toolkit: no" is useless; "ai-toolkit
 * has CUDA but is missing OpenCLIP, here is the command" is actionable. So every
 * row carries a per-dependency verdict and the backend refuses anything it could
 * not prove — a wrong pick would surface as an import error an hour into a pass.
