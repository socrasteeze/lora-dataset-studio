// 🔤 Text search — the wording that keeps a SIMILARITY RANKING from reading as a
// filter, kept out of the JSX so `node --test` can exercise it.
//
// The honesty problem this file exists for: a text search returns the N closest
// images, and "closest" is never "matching". Every image in the bank has some
// cosine to every phrase, so a result list ALWAYS comes back full, however wrong.
// If the UI just shows pictures, the user reads "these are the ones that match"
// — and a bad query produces a confident, wrong-looking answer with no signal.
// So three things are always said: that it is a ranking, how strong the top and
// bottom of it are, and how many images could not be searched at all.

// ── Why there is NO absolute quality scale here ──────────────────────────────
// CLIP text/image cosines are not spread over 0..1 and their useful band is far
// lower and narrower than intuition suggests. Measured on this codebase's exact
// model (ViT-L-14 / openai, CPU) over stock photographs: a CORRECT top-1 match
// peaked at 0.20–0.23, while unrelated pairs sat at 0.09–0.16. So the whole
// usable range was ≈0.09–0.23.
//
// That kills the obvious designs:
//   • an absolute threshold — a "sensible-looking" 0.25 cut returns NOTHING,
//     ever, including on perfect matches, and reads as "search is broken";
//   • a percentage — showing the best possible result as "22% match" reads as a
//     failure when it is in fact the ceiling;
//   • hard-coding 0.23 as "the top" — that figure came from five stock photos.
//     A bank of portraits, or of one person, will sit somewhere else entirely.
//
// So nothing here is absolute. Strength is expressed as the SPREAD WITHIN the
// returned set: how much weaker the last result is than the best one, as a
// fraction of the best. That question ("can I trust the tail?") is the one the
// user actually has, and it needs no universal constant to answer — it stays
// correct whatever band a particular bank happens to live in.
// The yardstick is measured, never assumed: `pool_median` is what a TYPICAL
// image of this bank scores for this query. So:
//     lift   = top - pool_median   → how far the best result stands out at all
//     spread = top - bottom        → how much the returned set varies internally
// Both are in the same (unknown, per-bank) units, so their RATIO is meaningful
// while neither value alone is. This matters most in the app's main use case: a
// bank dominated by one subject has image-to-image cosines of 0.60–0.89, and the
// discriminating gap of a query compresses by 30–70%. A rule written against an
// absolute band would simply never fire there; a ratio against the measured
// median fires exactly when the ranking stops separating anything.
