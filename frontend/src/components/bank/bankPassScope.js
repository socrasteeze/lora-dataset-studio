/* WHERE a bank pass runs, and how many images that really is.
 *
 * THE ASK. "Every one of these passes should be settable to kept, undecided,
 * unkept or all, to choose where it applies — or individually. Each button, once
 * pressed, opens a window showing the available options, with the launch button
 * at the end."
 *
 * TWO VOCABULARIES, on purpose — the same split bankCaptionScope.js already
 * draws. The user reads "Kept", "Undecided", "Unkept"; the wire and the database
 * carry 'keep', 'pending', 'reject', the values stored in the status column since
 * the bank existed. Renaming either side would break stored filters and saved
 * queries, so the translation lives here and nowhere else.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS A FIFTH VALUE, and it has to be. "Kept + undecided" is what
 * every pass has always run on (`status != 'reject'` server-side), so it is the
 * option that sends NOTHING — a run that leaves it alone posts the byte-identical
 * request it posted before this control existed. The four the maintainer asked
 * for sit under it and each name themselves explicitly.
 *
 * UNKEPT IS NEVER THE DEFAULT AND NEVER PART OF ONE. Aiming a pass at the bin
 * spends real time (GPU, for most of them) on images you already decided against.
 * It is offered, because "un-reject and re-run" was the only way to caption or
 * measure something you had set aside; it is never where a click lands by
 * accident, and the dialog states the cost next to the choice.
 *
 * EVERY LINE CARRIES ITS OWN COUNT, and that count is the number the run walks —
 * read off `payload.pass_scopes`, which the server computes from the SAME clause
 * each pass's pool filters on. A line that announces one figure while the pass
 * acts on another is the defect this whole surface exists to end (the 🧹
 * Auto-reject counter that offered "5 930" and moved 0).
 *
 * Plain .js (no JSX) so `node --test` can execute all of it.
