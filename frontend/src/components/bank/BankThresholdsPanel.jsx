/* 🎚 Filter thresholds — the twelve knobs that decide every Bank flag, edited
   WHERE THE TRIAGE HAPPENS instead of three screens away.

   WHY IT EXISTS. Tightening duplicate detection used to mean leaving the bank
   you were working in, walking to Settings ▸ Captioning & quality, editing a
   number with no idea what it would do, saving, and coming back to find out.
   Everything here is the same setting — the SAME `config.bank.<key>`, written
   through the SAME PUT /api/settings that Settings uses. There is no second
   copy and nothing to keep in sync: the two screens are one value seen twice.
   Editing here therefore changes it for EVERY bank, which the header says in
   plain words, above the fold, before anything is unfolded — that is the one
   real hazard of a shared setting and the only defence is to state it.

   Three things this panel does that a bare list of numbers cannot:

   1. It says WHICH WAY each knob catches more, as visible text. "Stricter" is
      not a direction: `dup_distance` is a DISTANCE (raise it to catch more) and
      `semantic_dup_threshold` is a SIMILARITY (lower it to catch more), and they
      sit next to each other. Getting one backwards looks exactly like the
      feature not working.
   2. It says WHEN a change lands — eight re-sort the bank the instant they are
      saved because the scan persists raw scores and verdicts are recomputed at
      read time; four are baked into stored groups by a pass. Those four carry
      the button that re-runs their own pass, so "applies at the next pass" is a
      gesture rather than an errand.
   3. It shows THE EFFECT: for the eight read-time thresholds it asks the server
      how many images the candidate value WOULD flag, live, before saving —
      "1 240 → 3 019 images flagged". The other four say they cannot, instead of
      showing a number that would describe the previous grouping.

   All wording, grouping, direction and validation live in bankThresholds.js so
   `node --test` can execute them (it parses .js, not .jsx), and every field is
   rendered from that table through a (section, field) pair — nothing here is
   wired to a specific knob, so a future per-bank override layer is a change of
   one resolver, not of twelve fields.

   The per-field reset is the SHARED settings button: one vocabulary for "Reset
   to default" across the app, and its value comes from the server's
   `config_defaults`, never from a number typed into the frontend. */
