/** 🚩 Bank watermark cleaning — the state of the two escalation levels (pure,
 * JSX-free so `node --test` exercises it directly).
 *
 * The feature is an ESCALATION, and the UI has to show where each level stands:
 * cheap and lossless first (crop off a border mark — invents no pixel), then the
 * expensive one (repaint what's left) on what the first level could not handle.
 * Both are launched by hand, so at every moment the panel must answer three
 * questions without the user guessing: how many images does THIS level still
 * have to work on, is the button live right now, and if not, WHY (and what to do
 * about it).
 *
 * Everything here derives from the /watermark/levels payload:
 *   flagged      — still carrying a watermark (both levels' pool)
 *   croppable    — of those, the ones the router would crop → level 2's share
 *   inpaintable  — the rest → level 3's share
 *   cropped / inpainted / dismissed — already handled, by which route
 *   needs_rescan — flagged by an older build with no box: nothing can route them
