// ⚖ Balanced selection — turning the backend's per-bucket numbers into words.
//
// The whole point of a balanced pick is that the user can SEE what they got:
// "20 face, 20 bust, 20 body" is the answer to a question no per-image score can
// ask ("does my set cover what I want to generate?"), and a selection that does
// not say its own shape is indistinguishable from an unbalanced one. So every
// readout here is NUMBERS, announceable as text — the coloured bar is decoration
// on top of a list a screen reader can read out, never the only carrier.
//
// Pure functions, no JSX: `node --test` cannot parse JSX, and the distribution
// is exactly the logic worth proving.

// Axis ids are persisted (localStorage) — NEVER rename one without an alias.
