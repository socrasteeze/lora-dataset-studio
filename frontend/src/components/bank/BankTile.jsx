/**
 * One image in the Bank grid.
 *
 * Moved out of BankWorkspace.jsx by the Encre redesign: in structure B the grid
 * is the CENTRE of the screen and full height, so the tile stopped being an
 * incidental detail of a four-zone stack and became the thing the page is for.
 *
 * Nothing about its behaviour changed — same three hit targets (select, ▶
 * review, ⛶ open), same badge cluster, same tooltip.

          Everything up there is a STATE READOUT — ✓, ✕, ⬆, the flags, the person
          and framing chips — and none of it is clickable. A button dropped in the
          middle of that row does not read as an action; in the maintainer's own
          words, "otherwise it gets drowned at the top with the icons that aren't
          clickable". The tile's two real actions live in this bottom-right group,
          so the third one joins them, in the same clothes.

          AND IT ONLY APPEARS WHEN IT CAN DELIVER. The chips ARE the words of the
          caption, so on an image whose caption yields none the picker could only
          say "This caption has no word worth filtering on." — a button promising
          something it cannot do. That silence has already cost once, the other way
          round: the feature had shipped for two days and was read as absent,
          because the bank simply had no captions. So the button says WHY it is
          not there, exactly the way a semantic action names its missing index
          on the pass row — a shipped feature that says nothing is indistinguishable
          from one that does not exist. */}
