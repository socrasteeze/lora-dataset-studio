/* THE ONE THING THE CAPTIONERS ARE KNOWN TO DO BADLY, said where it is decided.
 *
 * Plain .js (no JSX) so `node --test` executes all of it.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND BY WHOM
 * ------------------------------
 * This project's maintainer captioned one explicit test image with three
 * abliterated qwen3-vl builds (30b-a3b, 8b-instruct, 8b) and with JoyCaption.
 * All three qwen builds missed a person who was present in the image and each
 * described a generic act that was not the one in the picture; JoyCaption read the
 * same image correctly. Refusal was NOT the failure mode — the models answered
 * confidently, at length, about something else.
 *
 * That is the whole evidence base: ONE image, ONE session, THREE named builds. The
 * sentences below say exactly that and stop. They do not say "vision models
 * hallucinate", they do not say "Ollama is unreliable", and they must never be
 * edited into either — over-claiming about a third party's model would be the same
 * failure of honesty this feature exists to correct, pointed outward.
 *
 * WHY IT BELONGS IN THE CAPTION WINDOW
 * ------------------------------------
 * The default backend is 'auto', a CHAIN: JoyCaption writes what it can, the Ollama
 * vision model covers the rest. The measured failure is in the second half, and the
 * chain is invisible — the two halves land in the same column, in the same font.
 * The launch window is the last moment where the choice is still free and costs
 * nothing; afterwards the only remedy is re-reading captions one by one.
 *
 * WHEN IT STAYS QUIET, which is most of the time and is the point:
 *   · below CAPTION_NSFW_SHARE_MIN of the measured images — a bank that is
 *     incidentally spicy is not a bank this measurement is about, and a notice
 *     that fires everywhere is a notice nobody reads;
 *   · below CAPTION_NSFW_MEASURED_MIN measured images — "3 of 8" is not a share,
 *     it is noise, and quoting it would dress a coin flip up as a finding;
 *   · when ✨ Score has never run on the pile: the share is then UNKNOWN, not low.
 *     Silence is the honest reading — an unmeasured image is not a SFW image, and
 *     the app does not guess which. The cost is real and named here rather than
 *     hidden: on a never-scored bank this notice cannot fire at all.
 *
 * THE DENOMINATOR IS THE MEASURED ROWS, never the pile, for that same reason: a
 * share over the pile would silently count "never scored" as "not NSFW" and
 * understate itself on exactly the banks that need the sentence.
 */

/** At or above this share of the MEASURED images, the pass is running mostly on
 *  the material the failure was measured on.
 *
 *  A quarter, and not a majority: the failure is per image, not per bank. At 25%
 *  a 400-image run puts ~100 captions in the zone where a caption that describes
 *  something else would be indistinguishable from a good one — far past the point
 *  where a user who spot-checks a handful would happen to catch it. Going higher
 *  (a "majority") would stay silent on banks where a quarter of the work is
 *  affected; going lower would fire on ordinary portrait banks and turn the notice
 *  into furniture. */
