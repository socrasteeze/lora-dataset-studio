/** ↩ Undo the last bulk decision — pure helpers (no JSX, so `node --test`
 * can run them).
 *
 * Marking hundreds of images in one gesture is the bank's biggest lever. The
 * backend now snapshots the (status, reason) of every row a bulk action flips
 * and offers ONE step back, per bank, in the payload the workspace already
 * polls (`payload.undo` = {label, count, at}) — which is why the bar survives a
 * reload: the decision it takes back lives in the database, not in this tab.
 *
 * These helpers own the WORDING, and the wording is where the honesty lives.
 * Two rules run through the whole file:
 *   1. never promise what the server did not do — a restore that put 340 of 400
 *      rows back says so, and names what it left alone;
 *   2. never offer an undo for an action that cannot be undone cleanly. The
 *      server simply publishes no offer for Delete rejected or ⬆ Promote,
 *      so there is nothing here to accidentally render.
