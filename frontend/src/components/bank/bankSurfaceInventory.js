/** FROZEN before the Ink redesign. Every entry is an interactive surface a
 * user can click or read as a tooltip, with HOW MANY TIMES it occurs across the
 * Bank tree. The contract test asserts each one still occurs at least that many
 * times, anywhere in the tree.
 *
 * The count is not decoration. Several screens share a label — "Cancel",
 * "Close", "Open →" — and a plain set cannot tell "one is left" from "there
 * were two". Deleting BankPage's Open button left the test green because the
 * video lane has one too. Counting is what closes that hole, while still
 * letting a button MOVE between files for free.
 *
 * Adding a surface is fine and needs no edit here. Regenerating this file to
 * make a red test go green defeats its purpose: a surface that legitimately
 * disappears is edited out here in the SAME commit that removes it, with the
 * reason in the commit message. */
