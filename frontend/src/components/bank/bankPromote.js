/* ⬆ Promote — the DECIDABLE part of the two-destination dialog, kept free of
 * JSX so `node --test` can run it.
 *
 * Promoting used to lead exactly one place: a dataset. A dataset is the strict,
 * training-bound container — pulling 200 candidates out of a 9 000-image dump to
 * keep working on them is a different intent, and a dataset commits material the
 * user has not decided on yet. So there are two doors now, and the copy has to
 * say plainly which one is open and what it costs.
 *
 * The cost line is not decoration. Images average ~300 KB, so 200 of them are
 * ~60 MB and nobody needs a warning — but a video bank is three orders of
 * magnitude above that, and the same sentence has to stay true when it is. So
 * the dialog states a MEASURED figure from the server, or says it is still
 * measuring; it never guesses one.
