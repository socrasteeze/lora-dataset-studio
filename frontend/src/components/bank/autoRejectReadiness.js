/* 🧹 Auto-reject — what the two surfaces that offer it are allowed to CLAIM.
 *
 * The bug this file exists to close: the popover printed "(N flagged)" from the
 * payload's `flags` map, which counts EVERY image carrying the flag whatever its
 * status. The button behind it only ever touches undecided images (apply_flags
 * never overrides a ✓/✕, by design). On a fresh bank both are the same number
 * and nothing looks wrong; on the second pass they diverge by everything the
 * first pass rejected. Measured on a real 99 000-image bank: "🌫 Blurry 5 930"
 * offered, 0 rejected on click. The pass was fine. The counter was not.
 *
 * So the number next to a checkbox now comes from `flags_actionable` — the same
 * criterion narrowed to `status='pending'`, i.e. literally what the click flips.
 * `flags` stays untouched for the filter chips, where "show me every blurry
 * image, rejected ones included" is the right question.
 *
 * Two more things the surfaces have to distinguish, both of which used to render
 * as an identical `0`:
 *   - "nothing left to reject" — good news, the bank is clean on that axis;
 *   - "this flag CANNOT catch anything here" — its pass never produced data, so
 *     the 0 is a missing prerequisite, not a result.
 * And the pile no flag can reach at all: every quality flag is gated on
 * `quality_state == 'ok'`, so an image the scan never measured is invisible to
 * all of them. That is not "it is clean": it is "we know nothing about it".
 *
 * Pure and JSX-free on purpose — the wording is the deliverable, so it has to be
 * assertable without mounting a workspace.
