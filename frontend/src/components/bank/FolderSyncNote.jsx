/** 🗃️ The state of a bank's SOURCE FOLDER as of the last automatic walk.
 *
 * Shown on the bank card and in the workspace header. It only appears when
 * something is off — files listed in the bank that are no longer on disk, or a
 * folder that has gone away entirely. Both cases are reported, never acted on:
 * the bank keeps every row and every decision, because a disconnected drive
 * must not be able to erase a triage.
 *
 * Both cases also share the same usual cause — the folder moved — so when the
 * caller passes ``onRelocate`` the note carries the FIX and not only the
 * diagnosis: the user is already reading this line, which is where the button
 * belongs.
 *
 * ``onForget`` is the OTHER fix, for the other cause: the files really were
 * deleted, on purpose, and the count would otherwise be reported forever. It is
 * offered only alongside a reachable folder (folderSyncNote decides), because
 * with the drive unplugged every row looks missing and accepting would wipe the
 * triage. */
