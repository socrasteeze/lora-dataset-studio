       'refused'  — the bank is busy. The refusal is raised at THIS point on
                    purpose: it is the same 409 the pass itself would produce, so
                    the Launch all dialog still gets it while its checkboxes are

            it has to stay visible while it is active, and the review lightbox
            walks a FROZEN snapshot that a filter change could not honestly
            alter. Ticking re-filters immediately; the sentence spells out that

            common with the number of times it was cited."
