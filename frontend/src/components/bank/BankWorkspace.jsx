  /* 🔄 THE DESTRUCTIVE TWIN. Same endpoint, same options, plus `force:true` — which

     selects down with it, leaving a fully captioned bank with no way to redo its
     captions with a better model.

     THREE RULES, all of them about not lying:
     - it ASKS FIRST, with the count of captions it will destroy, in the Dataset's own

     - it never carries `image_ids`. A selection can span pages that were never loaded,
       so how many selected rows already have a caption is unknowable client-side, and
       this button does not run on a number it cannot state (see
       captionRecaptionDisabledReason). 🏷️ Caption still honours selections;

              round trip this layout was built to remove, reintroduced by a
              missing property. Pinned, the filters are beside the grid at every
              scroll position, and the empty band under a short rail is never on
              screen.
              It carries its own overflow: a rail taller than the viewport (many
              people, many tags) must scroll INSIDE its pin, otherwise its lower
              half becomes unreachable — worse than not pinning at all.
