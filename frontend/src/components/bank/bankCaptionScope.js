/* 🏷️ WHICH pile a caption pass is aimed at, and how many images that really is.
   Pure so the arithmetic behind the button label is unit-tested rather than eyeballed
   in a running app.

   TWO VOCABULARIES, on purpose. The user reads "Kept" and "Undecided"; the wire and the
   database carry 'keep' and 'pending' — the values stored in the status column since the
   bank existed. Renaming either side would break stored filters and saved queries, so the
   translation lives here and nowhere else.

   THE BIN IS NO LONGER OUT OF REACH — and that is a change of principle, held on purpose.
   'reject' used to be absent here and refused by the server ("you curate from what you
   might keep, never from what you threw away"). The maintainer asked to be able to aim a
   pass at the rejected pile, so it is now an explicit choice: never the default, never
   part of the default, and the launch window states what it costs (a full captioning call
   per rejected image — the slowest pass there is) next to the option itself.

   THE SCOPES THEMSELVES LIVE IN bankPassScope.js, shared with every other pass. One list
   means the word "Undecided" cannot come to mean two different piles on two screens. */

/* 🔄 RE-CAPTION — the same pass, forced, and the only DESTRUCTIVE thing this row can do.
 *
 * Why it has to exist at all: 🏷️ Caption skips rows that already carry a caption, so on a
 * fully captioned bank its run size is 0 and the button greys out — taking the engine, the
 * model and the pile selects down with it. The dials added beside them would be unreachable
 * on exactly the bank whose captions you want to redo with a better model.
 *
 * WHAT IT NOW SPARES. Captions carry an origin (backend services/caption_origin.py, the
 * 'asserted' token BankImage.face_cluster_origin already uses), so the pass SKIPS the ones a
 * human wrote or corrected instead of warning that it cannot tell them apart. That warning
 * used to be the honest thing to say; it is now the wrong thing to do.
 *
 * THREE COUNTS, THREE SENTENCES, and they are never merged:
 *   - what the run REWRITES — the number the button quotes, and the number the job walks;
 *   - what it KEEPS BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT — the protection, stated as a measured figure;
 *   - what it rewrites WHOSE ORIGIN WAS NEVER RECORDED — every caption written before the
 *     column existed. Those are re-captioned (their authorship cannot be recovered, and
 *     sparing them would make this button inert on every bank that exists today) but they
 *     are NOT "generated captions", and calling them that would be the app claiming to know
 *     something it does not. On a bank that predates the column this figure is the whole
 *     overwrite, which is exactly the warning the user needs.
 *
 * THE WAY OUT is a separate tick (`includeAsserted`), offered only when there is something
 * to protect, never pre-ticked, and named in its own confirmation. Someone who deliberately
 * wants their own captions redone by a better model must be able to; they must not get there
 * by leaving a key out of a request. bank_undo covers (status, reject_reason) and says in its
 * own header that it offers undo for nothing else — there is no undo to promise here either. */
