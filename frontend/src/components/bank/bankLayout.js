/**
 * The Bank workspace's LAYOUT state — the "structure B" half of the redesign:
 * a top bar, a filter rail beside the grid it filters, and the analysis passes
 * in a panel opened on demand.
 *
 * Why this is a .js and not part of the component: the rail's folding rules and
 * the facet-group model are the only genuinely NEW logic the redesign adds, and
 * `node --test` cannot parse JSX. Logic that lives in the .jsx is logic that
 * cannot be tested, so it lives here and the component stays a renderer.
 *
 * The problem the structure solves: the workspace used to be four zones stacked
 * vertically, so adjusting a filter meant scrolling up, clicking, and scrolling
 * back down to see what changed. On a bank of 20 000+ images that round trip is
 * the cost — not the click count.
