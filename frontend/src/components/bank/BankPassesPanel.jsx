/**
 * ⚙ The analysis passes — the old ① Analyze zone, now a PANEL opened on demand
 * from the top bar.
 *
 * Why it moved. The passes are the step you run once per bank and then leave
 * alone for days, and they were occupying the top third of a screen whose
 * subject is the grid. Opening them on demand gives that third back to the
 * images without taking a single pass away.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a CONTAINER, not a rewrite. All eight passes are here, each still
 * opening its own PassDialog with its own endpoint, scope and refusals. Nothing
 * about what a button does changed — only where you reach it from. The
 * bank-wide read-only overview rides along, because "what has been measured"
 * and "what can I measure" are the same question asked twice.
