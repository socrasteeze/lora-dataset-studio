/* Wiring contract for the ✨ Score interpreter picker.
 *
 * The logic is unit-tested in scoringPython.test.js; what a rewrite of the
 * workspace silently loses is the WIRING — the entry point, the refresh after a
 * change, the read-only promise in the dialog. Those are one-line facts with no
 * runtime assertion anywhere, exactly the kind that dies unnoticed.
