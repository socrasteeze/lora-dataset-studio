/* Starting a bank pass FROM A BUTTON: whether the button can work right now,
 * what to say when the server refuses, and what the pass actually produced.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS REPLACES. The threshold panel offers "↻ Re-group duplicates"
 * next to the duplicate knobs. A bank runs ONE background job at a time, so
 * while any other pass is in flight that button cannot possibly work — yet it
 * looked exactly like a button that could, and the only feedback was the
 * server's own sentence, "a scan job is already running on this bank", pasted
 * into a red toast. That sentence names no progress, no remedy, and no place to
 * go. And when the click DID work, the pass returned 202 and said nothing: on a
 * small bank a re-group over stored hashes is over before the next 2 s poll, so
 * the workspace's completion toast (which only fires for a job it observed
 * alive) never fired either. Both halves of the click were silent.
 *
 * "Before the next poll" is a SMALL bank and nothing more — the line that used
 * to live here said a re-group always finishes inside the poll, and that was
 * measured false: 96 to 124 s on a 50 000-image bank, which is exactly how the
 * pass came to look like a frozen application. The grouping now reports its own
 * progress and honours Stop like every other pass, so this file's job is to
 * report what a pass it WATCHED produced, never to assume one was too quick to
 * see.
 *
 * THREE FUNCTIONS, ONE RULE EACH:
 *   passButtonState  — a button that cannot work must not look like one, and
 *                      must say WHICH pass is holding the bank and where it is.
 *   busyRefusal      — a 409 is rephrased into blocker + progress + remedy.
 *                      The raw server string is never shown.
 *   passOutcome      — a finished pass reports its NUMBERS, from the counts the
 *                      bank payload already carries.
 *
 * No new progress mechanism lives here. Liveness comes from `progressPresence`
 * (the offline/stale patron already shipped) fed with the SAME `payload.activity`
 * snapshot the Bank's progress bar reads, and the numbers come from the SAME
 * `payload.dup` / `payload.semantic_dup` summaries the duplicate chips count.
 *
 * Plain .js (no JSX) so `node --test` can execute all of it.
