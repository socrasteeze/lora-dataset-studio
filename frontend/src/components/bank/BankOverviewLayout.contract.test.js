     Analyze with the overview and Curate with Promote. The Encre redesign
     replaced that stack on purpose — scrolling up to a filter and back down to
     its result was the actual complaint — so the invariant is rewritten, not
     relaxed. What has to stay true is the same thing it always protected: the
     screen is a single column on a phone and uses the width on a desktop.

     Two columns, not twelve: the rail has one job and a fixed measure, so a
     twelve-column grid would only be a more expensive way of writing 17rem.

     The breakpoint is `lg`, not `sm`, and that is the point of the assertion:
     a 17rem rail FITS from 640 px, but it leaves the grid ~350 px — two
     thumbnails — and a triage screen that shows two images is not one. The
     rail stays a drawer until the grid keeps a workable width. Pinning the
     literal here keeps it in step with RAIL_SIDE_BY_SIDE_PX, which the layout
     module tests on the same reasoning. */

     filter and back down to its result. A rail that is merely PLACED beside
     the grid does not deliver that: it is ~500 px tall against a grid that is
     thousands (20 000 images), so it leaves the viewport after one screen and
     the round trip comes straight back. Measured on a 48-image bank at 1440:
     page 2 326 px, rail ending at ~1 345 — the lower 1 000 px of grid had no
     filters beside it at all.

     Three parts, and the assertion names all three because dropping any one
     silently restores the defect:
       · `sticky` — the pin itself;
       · `self-start` — without it the grid item STRETCHES to the row height,
         so the element is already as tall as its container and sticky has no
         room to travel. This is the failure that looks like "sticky doesn't
         work" and gets fixed by deleting sticky;
       · `overflow-y-auto` + a viewport-bounded max height — a rail taller than
         the screen must scroll inside its pin, or its lower half becomes
         permanently unreachable, which is worse than never pinning.
     All four are `lg:`-scoped, matching the breakpoint at which the rail is a
     column at all; below it the rail is a `fixed` drawer, where sticky is
     meaningless. */

     ⚠️ This last assertion is the one that matters most, because the failure it
     guards is SILENT: an undefined custom property makes the whole `calc()`
     invalid, `top` falls back to `auto`, and a `sticky` element with no `top`
     simply never pins. Nothing errors, nothing looks broken in review — the
     rail just quietly scrolls away again and the layout loses its reason to
     exist. Deleting the token from index.css must break a test, not a screen. */
