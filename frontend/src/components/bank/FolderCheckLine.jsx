/** 🗃️ Bank list — how fresh these cards are, and the one click that refreshes them.
 *
 * The list used to re-walk every bank's source folder before rendering: a full
 * inventory of the whole library paid on every navigation to a page people
 * often only pass through (690-1 190 ms on a real 8-bank / 86 493-image
 * library). It no longer does — a folder is re-checked when its bank is OPENED,
 * or from here.
 *
 * That trade is only acceptable because this line exists. A list that is
 * silently late is worse than a list that is slow: the user would read counts
 * as facts. So the page says what it knows and offers the walk, instead of
 * doing it behind their back on every visit.
 *
 * flex-wrap + a growing sentence: at 400 px the text takes the row and the
 * button drops underneath it, rather than squeezing into two characters. */
