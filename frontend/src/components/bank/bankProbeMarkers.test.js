/* 📐 The markers the responsive probe measures the Bank by.
 *
 * `scripts/responsiveProbe.mjs` renders the Bank workspace at real viewport
 * sizes and measures what came out. It finds the surfaces by attribute, never
 * by class — which leaves one hole: delete the attributes and it measures
 * nothing and says the page is fine. These assertions run in `node --test`, on
 * every commit, and keep the probe pointed at the right elements.
 *
 * ⚠️ Source text cannot tell you the layout is good; only the probe can. This
 * file guarantees that the thing which CAN tell you still has its markers.
 *
 * First measured 2026-08-23 on a throwaway instance: 412 violations on the
 * first run (a 1 550-px passes panel opening itself on a 360-px phone, 384
 * controls under 40 px, a header taking 38 % of the fold at rest), 0 after. */
