/**
 * The Bank's small shared primitives — the chip, the counter, the eyebrow, the
 * facet cluster and the pass button.
 *
 * They were defined inside BankWorkspace.jsx while there was one file to define
 * them in. The Encre redesign splits that screen into a top bar, a filter rail
 * and a passes panel, and all three draw chips and eyebrows; a primitive that
 * lives in one of them would have been copied into the other two.
 *
 * These render UI only. Anything with a decision in it belongs in bankLayout.js
 * or one of the other pure modules, where `node --test` can actually reach it.
 *
 * These carry NO palette of their own. A trialled "Encre" skin was dropped in
 * favour of the app's existing colours, so an atom that hard-coded a hex here
 * would be the one thing standing between the Bank and the rest of the app.
