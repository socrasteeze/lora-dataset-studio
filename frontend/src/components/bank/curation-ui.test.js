// Regression guard for the reported symptom "🎨 Pick diverse and 🎯 Similar to
// selected show EXACTLY the same thing, whatever the reference". The backend
// selectors were always distinct and reference-sensitive; the bug was that the
// grid kept showing its default facet page and only scattered invisible
// checkmarks across a 24k-image bank, so BOTH buttons looked identical. The fix
// is that each selector feeds ITS OWN returned ids into a "show selected"
// (?ids=…) grid view. These assertions lock that wiring so a refactor can't
// collapse the two buttons back into the same, ref-insensitive view.
