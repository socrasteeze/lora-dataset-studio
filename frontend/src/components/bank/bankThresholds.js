/* 🎚 Bank triage thresholds — the DESCRIPTION of the twelve knobs, and the pure
   logic the Bank's threshold panel runs on.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   The twelve thresholds that decide every Bank flag lived in exactly one place:
   Settings ▸ Captioning & quality. So tightening duplicate detection meant
   leaving the bank you were triaging, finding a card three screens away in a
   different area of the app, editing a number, saving, and coming back to see
   whether it did anything. The panel this file backs puts all twelve where the
   work happens.

   ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH, NOT TWO. This module describes the fields — their group,
   their unit, which direction catches more, when they take effect. It holds NO
   default values: those come from the server (`config_defaults.bank`, derived
   from config.DEFAULTS), exactly like Settings ▸ Captioning, and the shared
   ResetToDefault button reads them. A default typed here would drift the day
   config.py moves and the reset button would then restore a stale number while
   claiming it is the default — bankThresholds.test.js fails the build if one
   appears. Both screens edit `config.bank.<key>` through the same PUT
   /api/settings, so there is no third source of truth and no sync problem: they
   are the same value seen twice.

   KEYS ARE PERSISTED. `field` is the config key inside the `bank` section and
   lives in every user's config.json. Never rename one without an alias.

   THE DIRECTION TRAP (this is why `catchesMoreWhen` exists)
   --------------------------------------------------------
   "Stricter" is a meaningless word here, because it points opposite ways for
   different knobs, and two of them are exact mirrors of each other:

     dup_distance          is a DISTANCE  (dHash bits) — RAISE it to catch more
     semantic_dup_threshold is a SIMILARITY (cosine)   — LOWER it to catch more

   Both are "make duplicate detection catch more", and they move in opposite
   directions. A UI that does not say so out loud will get set backwards, and
   backwards looks exactly like "it did nothing". So every field carries the ONE
   unambiguous fact — which way makes this filter catch MORE images — and the
   panel prints it as a sentence next to the input, not as a hidden tooltip.

   Pure functions and data, no JSX, so `node --test` can execute this file
   (it parses .js, not .jsx). The panel itself is BankThresholdsPanel.jsx. */

/* Groups, ordered as they render. Grouped by the QUESTION the user is asking —
   not by the historical order of config.py — because that is how someone
   arrives at these controls: "why is this junk still here?" has a different
   answer from "why are these two copies not grouped?".

   `defaultOpen` decides what is visible without a click. The two open groups
   are the ones a mixed dump actually gets retuned on; the other three are
   answers to narrower questions and stay folded, which is also what keeps the
   panel readable at 400 px. */

/* When a change takes effect. The Bank recomputes verdicts from PERSISTED raw
   scores at read time, so most of these re-sort the grid the instant they are

/* The pass that has to re-run for a non-instant threshold to mean anything —
   offered as a BUTTON next to the field, because "applies at the next pass" is
   only half an answer if the next pass is somewhere else on the page.

   The duplicate one is the cheap surprise: a scan with rescan off has an empty
   pool on an already-scanned bank, so re-grouping thousands of images costs a
   walk over stored hashes, no decode. Worth saying, or the button reads as
   "rescan 36 000 files" and nobody presses it.

   `body` is what makes that true AND safe. The quality scan only regroups when
   the hashes it stored actually moved — regrouping 50 000 unchanged hashes at
   the tail of a scan that had 2 images to look at is what froze the app for two
   minutes. This button asks for the grouping on purpose, so it keeps working on
   a bank where the scan itself has nothing to do. */
