/**
 * The Bank's facet TABLES — the flag labels, the resolution/framing/origin
 * buckets and the tile status rings.
 *
 * Pulled out of BankWorkspace.jsx by the Encre redesign because the filter rail,
 * the tiles and the auto-reject sheet now live in three different files and all
 * three read the same tables. Copying them would have been the start of a drift
 * between what a chip is called in the rail and what the same flag is called on
 * a tile.
 *
 * ⚠️ Several `id`s here MUST mirror backend keys (noted per table). They are also
 * stored — in filter query strings and in localStorage — so the repo rule on
 * stored identifiers applies: never rename one without an alias path.
