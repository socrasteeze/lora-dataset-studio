// data does:
//   * an assertion is the USER'S WORD, never a measurement — the panel never
//     phrases it as something the app found out;
//   * a sample check looked at ~15 images, so it may only ever speak about the
//     sample. "sample consistent" is not "this folder is clean", and the copy
//     must not let one be read as the other.
