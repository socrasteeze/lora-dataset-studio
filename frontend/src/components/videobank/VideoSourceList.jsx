/** 🎬 The per-FILE view: what each rush is, and how far it got.
 *
 * Cards rather than a table, and that is a 400 px decision: a table with five
 * columns of which one is an unbreakable path either scrolls the whole page
 * sideways or truncates the only column that identifies the row.
 *
 * Clicking a file filters the shot grid to it — the question this list actually
 * gets asked is "what came out of THAT file", and answering it by scrolling a
 * grid of three hundred shots is not answering it.
 *
 * ✂ CUT A SHOT BY HAND lives here and not only in the lightbox, and that is the
 * whole point of it: every other retouch gesture needs an open shot, and a file
 * that detection missed entirely — or a bank on an install with no detector, which
 * the app explicitly says can still "scan, cut, watch and triage" — has none. It
 * makes the first shot, which the lightbox then trims and splits.
