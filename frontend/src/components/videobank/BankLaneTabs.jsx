/** The kind of bank you are making — 🖼 images or 🎬 video.
 *
 * WHY A SWITCH AND NOT A SIXTH NAV ITEM. The desktop bar already carries five
 * workspaces and overflows at exactly 768 px (see App.jsx). More to the point,
 * these are not two workspaces: they are one job — "triage a folder before it
 * becomes a dataset" — over two kinds of material. Someone with a folder of
 * rushes looks for the Bank, and today the Bank ignores every .mp4 in it
 * WITHOUT SAYING SO. This switch is where that silence ends.
 *
 * They stay two separate routes, and two separate sets of components, because
 * the work genuinely differs: a video bank cuts one file into hundreds of shots,
 * stores bounds rather than files, and encodes only at promotion.
