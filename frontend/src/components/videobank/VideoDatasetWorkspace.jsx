/** 🎬 ONE video dataset, worked on — the surface this lane did not have.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING AND WHY IT MATTERED. A video dataset used to be a CARD at the
 * bottom of the library: an accordion listing its clips, one textarea each, and
 * the training block. Everything you would actually work a set with — a grid, a
 * player, a search, bulk edits — existed only on the BANK, which triages SHOTS,
 * before any encode. So the object you are about to spend a night (or a pod
 * bill) training on was the one object in the app you could not look at
 * properly. The image lane has never worked that way, and CLAUDE.md's standing
 * rule is that a difference between the two surfaces is the maintainer's call,
 * not an accident of what got built first.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, so nobody reads its absence as an oversight:
 *  · the quality passes (dedup, watermark, safe zone, defects) run on the bank's
 *    shots, on the SOURCE files, before an encode exists. Re-running them on
 *    encoded clips is a different pipeline, not a port;
 *  · trimming. A bank clip is a pair of bounds and a trim is free; a dataset clip
 *    is an encoded file at a fixed frame count, and shortening it means encoding
 *    it again. The honest gesture is to re-cut in the bank, which is why the
 *    lightbox names the source rush and the timecode;
 *  · an export section. A video dataset IS its output folder — a flat directory
 *    of .mp4 and homonym .txt, which is exactly what every trainer reads.
