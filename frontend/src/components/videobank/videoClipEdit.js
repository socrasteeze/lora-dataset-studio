/** ✂ Retouching one shot's bounds — pure helpers (no JSX, so `node --test` runs them).
 *
 * The detector is good and it is not right. It misses a boundary on a slow
 * dissolve, and it hands back shots whose last second is a frozen frame. Until
 * these helpers existed the only gesture available on either was ✕ Reject, which
 * throws away eight good seconds to be rid of one bad one.
 *
 * THE PLAYHEAD IS IN SOURCE TIME, AND THAT IS THE ONE FACT EVERYTHING HERE RESTS
 * ON. The lightbox mounts ONE <video> pointed at the SOURCE file with a media
 * fragment (`…/source/12/media#t=41.25,50`). The resource is the whole rush, so
 * the element's timeline is the rush's timeline: `duration` is the file's, and
 * `currentTime` reads 43.9 while playing the shot that starts at 41.25. The
 * fragment moves the initial seek and the stop point, not the origin. So no
 * conversion is needed — but "no conversion needed" is exactly the kind of claim
 * that rots the day someone points the player at a per-clip file, and a split at
 * the wrong instant is silent: you get two shots, both plausible, neither where
 * you asked. Hence `playheadToSourceTime`, which asserts the invariant instead of
 * assuming it, and answers null rather than a guess when the reading cannot be in
 * this shot.
 *
 * WHY NO DRAGGABLE TIMELINE. Nudge buttons and "set to playhead" cover the two
 * things that actually happen during triage — shave a frozen tail, move a start
 * onto the first clean frame — with a gesture that works at 400 px and on a
 * trackpad. A scrubbable filmstrip is a large piece of UI whose extra precision
 * lands below one frame.
