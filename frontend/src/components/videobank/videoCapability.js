/** 🎬 The video extra, reported as THREE pieces — and never as one verdict.
 *
 * This is the whole reason this lane exists as a separate one. Today a `.mp4`
 * dropped into an image bank is skipped in silence: no row, no warning, nothing.
 * Replacing that silence with a single "video is unavailable" banner would be
 * the same defect wearing a hat — it is how a user reinstalls the wrong thing.
 *
 * Decoding, shot detection and encoding fail INDEPENDENTLY and are fixed
 * differently: one is a pip package, one is a pip package that drags torch, one
 * is a binary on PATH. So the UI says which piece is missing, what it costs, and
 * — the part that matters most — what still works without it. With no encoder
 * you can scan a folder, detect every shot, watch them and triage the whole
 * bank; the only thing you cannot do is promote.
 *
 * PURE: no JSX, no fetch. `node --test` imports it directly.
