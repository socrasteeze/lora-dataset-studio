 * The backend stores RAW scores and derives flags at read time against the cuts

 * Two decisions worth stating:
 *
 * "Unmeasured" is a state of its own, never "clean". A clip with no flags
 * because nothing was measured and a clip with no flags because it is fine are
 * different facts — collapsing them makes a half-scanned bank look healthy.
 *
 * And the dry-run sentence changes TONE when a cut would flag most of the bank.
 * The failure mode is documented: a public pipeline once kept 47 clips out of
 * 1493 with one mis-set threshold and discovered it after the fact. A preview
 * that reports "400 clips flagged" in the same cheerful voice as "4 clips
 * flagged" does not prevent that.
