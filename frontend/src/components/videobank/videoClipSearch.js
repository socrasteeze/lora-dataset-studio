// 🔎 Find scenes — the wording that keeps a SIMILARITY RANKING over shots from
// reading as a filter, kept out of the JSX so `node --test` can exercise it.
//
// The image lane already solved most of this problem and its reasoning is not
// repeated here — it is IMPORTED (see bankTextSearch.js for the measurements
// behind the spread bands, the readiness hints and the negation trap). Two lanes
// with two copies of the same calibrated sentences is how one of them quietly
// stops being true.
//
// WHAT IS GENUINELY DIFFERENT ABOUT VIDEO, and therefore lives here:
//
//  1. A result is a SHOT, and a shot is a span of time. The backend embeds
//     several frames of it and scores it by the best one, so a result carries a
//     SECOND — the moment that actually matched. Showing the shot without the
//     second hands the user a thirty-second clip and tells them the answer is
//     somewhere inside it, which is barely better than not answering.
//  2. That second is ABSOLUTE, in the source file's own timeline, because the
//     player streams the source and addresses it with a media fragment. Treating
//     it as an offset from the shot's start lands the playhead in the wrong shot.
//  3. "Not embedded" is a much more likely state here than in the image lane. A
//     bank of rushes is triaged long before anyone thinks to search it, so the
//     honest default is to explain the pass rather than to return an empty grid.
