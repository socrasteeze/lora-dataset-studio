/** 🎬 Reading a video bank at a glance — counters, the live pass, and what to
 * click next.
 *
 * A video bank has a strict order of operations that an image bank does not:
 * detection needs the probe's frame rate, thumbnails need the detected shots,
 * and promotion needs kept clips. Running them out of order is not an error —
 * each pass simply finds nothing to do and reports success, which reads exactly
 * like "this app does not work with my files". So the workspace names the ONE
 * next step instead of laying out four equal buttons and wishing you luck.
 *
 * PURE: no JSX, no fetch.
