/** 🎬 Watching ONE shot — the only <video> element this lane ever mounts.
 *
 * The grid holds JPEGs and nothing else (see videoClipFragment.js for the two
 * reasons: no clip file exists before promotion, and Chrome silently stops
 * loading new players past roughly forty). This component is where that budget
 * is spent, once.
 *
 * The element is KEYED on the clip so React recreates it when you move to the
 * next shot: assigning a new `#t=` to a live <video> is ignored by several
 * browsers once the resource is loaded, and the viewer then watches the previous
 * shot's range while the caption names a different one. `shouldRemountPlayer`
 * owns that decision, and the key is derived from it rather than from the clip
 * id, so "same source, same start" never restarts playback from the head.
 *
 * That rule pays for itself once the ✂ retouch tools land here: saving a new
 * START swaps the clip row in place, the descriptor changes, and the player is
 * recreated on the new `#t=` — so you immediately watch the range you just cut
 * instead of the one you cut it from. Saving only the END deliberately does not
 * remount: the range you are watching still opens at the same instant, and
 * restarting playback there would be a punishment for trimming a tail.
