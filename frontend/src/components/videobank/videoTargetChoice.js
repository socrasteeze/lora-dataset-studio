/** 🎬 Choosing what to promote a bank INTO — the target, the length, the size.
 *
 * TWO FIELDS OF THE CATALOGUE ARE THE POINT OF THIS FILE, and neither is a
 * footnote:
 *
 *   `training_verified` — whether a LoRA trainer for this target is known to
 *     exist. The app can know a model's geometry perfectly and still have no way
 *     to train it. ONE target out of the four clears this bar. Someone who picks
 *     an unverified one and finds out afterwards has spent a week of cutting,
 *     captioning and GPU time on a dataset nothing can read.
 *
 *   `licence_note` — MiniMax H3's Community Licence grants rights only inside an
 *     "Applicable Territory" that EXCLUDES the EU, the UK, South Korea and the
 *     USA, and the restriction reaches the OUTPUTS. Keeping the training private
 *     is not a way around it. That belongs where the choice is made, not in a
 *     doc nobody opens.
 *
 * Both are therefore surfaced BY THIS MODULE, at the picker, and pinned by tests
 * — a target that quietly loses its warning is a regression, not a tidy-up.
 *
 * THE LENGTH SELECTOR OFFERS FRAME COUNTS FROM THE CATALOGUE, NEVER A FREE FIELD
 * IN SECONDS. The frame rule is a property of each model's VAE, not of video:
 * 29 frames is legal for Wan and illegal for LTX; MiniMax wants f % 17 == 5. A
 * seconds field would produce an illegal count on every keystroke, and the
 * trainers do not refuse it — they floor it in latent space, silently.
 *
 * PURE: no JSX, no fetch.
