/** A "this is configurable, here" pointer, placed where the user is ACTING rather
 * than in Settings where they are not. Several features are driven by a setting
 * that is discoverable only by knowing it exists — the manual Upscale & improve
 * being the reported case: its strength and instruction are editable, and nothing
 * on the button said so.
 *
 * `section` is a Settings section id from components/settings/registry.js
 * (overview | engines | scraping | local-tools | captioning | training | server |
 * maintenance). A plain hash anchor rather than a router Link: these sit inside
 * lightboxes and panels that are sometimes portaled, where a bare <a> is the one
 * form that behaves identically everywhere.
 *
 * `focus` (optional): the DOM id of the ONE field the label promises. A label
 * that names a single setting must land ON it — "Adjust improve strength →"
 * dropping the reader at the top of Image engines is the reported complaint.
 * URL building lives in settingsLinkHref.js so node --test can lock it; the
 * arrival behaviour (scroll, open collapsed <details>, ring) is SettingsPage's
 * existing ?focus= deep link, reused rather than re-implemented.
 * Omit it when the label honestly covers a whole section — a target that lies is
 * worse than none. tests/settings-link-target-contract.test.mjs keeps every
 * target pointing at a field that is really rendered.
 *
 * `tone`: 'subtle' (default) for an ambient hint, 'warning' inside an amber block
 * that is already telling the user something is missing.
