/**
 * 📡 The app's single, quiet voice for "I can't reach the server right now".
 *
 * Replaces the stack of "Connection lost" toasts a failing poll used to emit.
 * It is deliberately ONE node that mounts when the outage opens and unmounts
 * when it closes: `role="status"` announces it once, and nothing inside it
 * changes while it is up (no ticking counter), so it is never re-announced.
 *
 * The second sentence is the point of the whole fix: a bank pass, a caption
 * batch and a training run all live in server-side threads, and the page
 * losing contact says nothing about them. Silence used to read as "it stopped".
