/* Editable "built-in default" prompts — the ONE rule both surfaces obey.
   PURE JS (no JSX) so node --test can import and exercise it directly.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   These prompts (config `identity_prompts.*`) are stored as a GLOBAL override
   whose blank value means "follow the shipped default". The backend enforces
   that literally: `face_variations.get_identity_prompt` only honours an override
   when it holds non-blank text, otherwise it returns the hardcoded constant
   byte-for-byte, and `config.DEFAULTS` ships each string as '' on purpose.

   The UI used to expose that as TWO boxes — an empty field plus a read-only
   "Built-in default (currently in use)" block with a "Load default to edit"
   button. One box is better, but pre-filling a single box with the default text
   would quietly PERSIST A COPY of it: the user follows the default today, saves
   an identical string, and every future improvement to the shipped prompt stops
   reaching them, silently and forever.

   So the single box SHOWS the default and is editable, and this module is what
   keeps the storage honest: text equal to the shipped default (ignoring only
   surrounding whitespace) normalises back to '' — "following the default" —
   and only genuinely different text is stored as an override. Every onChange
   goes through `normalizePromptOverride`, so the config never holds a frozen
   copy at any point, not just at save time. */

/** The value to STORE for a prompt box holding `value`, given the shipped
 *  `defaultText`. '' means "follow the built-in default" (the backend contract).
 *  Blank input, or input equal to the default up to surrounding whitespace,
 *  collapses to '' — anything else is a real override, kept verbatim. */
export function normalizePromptOverride(value, defaultText) {
  const raw = typeof value === 'string' ? value : '';
  if (!raw.trim()) return '';
  const def = typeof defaultText === 'string' ? defaultText : '';
  if (raw === def || raw.trim() === def.trim()) return '';
  return raw;
}

/** True when the stored value means "use the shipped default". */
export function isFollowingDefault(value, defaultText) {
  return normalizePromptOverride(value, defaultText) === '';
}

/** What the single box DISPLAYS: the override when there is one, otherwise the
 *  real shipped default (never an empty box behind a placeholder). */
export function promptBoxText(value, defaultText) {
  const raw = typeof value === 'string' ? value : '';

/* Shared metadata for the editable identity prompts — imported by BOTH the
   Settings card and the workspace modal so the two surfaces can never drift
   apart on labels, keys or which engine a prompt actually drives.
   `key` mirrors config identity_prompts.* — NEVER renamed (persisted globally).
   `engines` says which engine family really consumes the prompt, verified in
   face_variations.py: wrap_variation picks face_multi/face_single for the API
   engines, and BOTH local engines share `_compose_edit_prompt`, which always
   reads klein_identity — wrap_variation_klein and wrap_variation_krea alike.
   Hence "Local engines", not "Klein": the box was named after one of its two
   consumers, and a user asked on Discord whether it applied to Krea 2 at all.
   A prompt this file names after one engine is a prompt the other engine's
   users will leave alone. */

/** The engines whose prompts go through wrap_variation, i.e. every API engine.
 *  Listed once: an engine missing from here would silently be treated as Klein
 *  by activeExtraRefPromptKey and badge the wrong prompt box.
 *
 *  DIVERGENCE 1: EMPTY on this fork, and kept as an empty export rather than
 *  deleted — the same choice, for the same reason, as `API_ENGINES` in
 *  dataset/engineSelection.js. Every helper here derives from it, so an empty
 *  list makes them all answer correctly BY CONSTRUCTION instead of by special
 *  case: the two `face_*` locks declare no consumer and are never badged, the
 *  shared outfit/expression directives fall back to Klein alone, and
 *  activeExtraRefPromptKey resolves every engine to `klein_identity`. Never add
 *  an id. The two lists are pinned together by
 *  tests/local-engine-prompt-labels-contract.test.mjs, precisely so a sync that
 *  refilled one and not the other could not hand this fork a paid prompt lane
 *  with nothing else noticing. */

   An identity lock is written FOR A SUBJECT. Storing one text for all of them is

   tails, extra limbs, odd footwear (reported by ashish.sinha on Discord).

   Layout, mirroring backend face_variations.identity_prompt_config_key:

     non-human  -> identity_prompts.by_subject.<type>.<kind>
   Human deliberately keeps the flat key: every override written before this fix
   landed there (the editor showed human text and had no subject selector), so
   reading it as the human override preserves it with no migration. A non-human
   subject NEVER falls back to it — that fallback is the bug.
   `klein_improve` (+ its toggle) stays flat and global: it is a subject-agnostic
   quality instruction, identical in all five default tables. */
