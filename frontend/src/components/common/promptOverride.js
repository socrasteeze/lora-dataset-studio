/* Editable "built-in default" prompts — the ONE rule both surfaces obey.
   PURE JS (no JSX) so node --test can import and exercise it directly.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   These prompts (config `identity_prompts.*`) are stored as a GLOBAL override
   whose blank value means "follow the shipped default". The backend enforces
   that literally: `face_variations.get_identity_prompt` only honours an override
   when it holds non-blank text, otherwise it returns the hardcoded constant
   byte-for-byte, and `config.DEFAULTS` ships each string as '' on purpose.

   The UI used to expose that as TWO boxes — an empty field plus a read-only
   "Built-in default (currently in use)" block with a "Load default to edit"
   button. One box is better, but pre-filling a single box with the default text
   would quietly PERSIST A COPY of it: the user follows the default today, saves
   an identical string, and every future improvement to the shipped prompt stops
   reaching them, silently and forever.

   So the single box SHOWS the default and is editable, and this module is what
   keeps the storage honest: text equal to the shipped default (ignoring only
   surrounding whitespace) normalises back to '' — "following the default" —
   and only genuinely different text is stored as an override. Every onChange
   goes through `normalizePromptOverride`, so the config never holds a frozen
   copy at any point, not just at save time. */

/** The value to STORE for a prompt box holding `value`, given the shipped
 *  `defaultText`. '' means "follow the built-in default" (the backend contract).
 *  Blank input, or input equal to the default up to surrounding whitespace,
 *  collapses to '' — anything else is a real override, kept verbatim. */
export function normalizePromptOverride(value, defaultText) {
  const raw = typeof value === 'string' ? value : '';
  if (!raw.trim()) return '';
  const def = typeof defaultText === 'string' ? defaultText : '';
  if (raw === def || raw.trim() === def.trim()) return '';
  return raw;
}

/** True when the stored value means "use the shipped default". */

/* --- Per-subject-type storage ------------------------------------------------
   An identity lock is written FOR A SUBJECT. Storing one text for all of them is
   what let a prompt tuned on an Animal dataset ride on human generations —
   tails, extra limbs, odd footwear (reported by ashish.sinha on Discord).

   Layout, mirroring backend face_variations.identity_prompt_config_key:
     human      -> identity_prompts.<kind>                    (the ORIGINAL key)
     non-human  -> identity_prompts.by_subject.<type>.<kind>
   Human deliberately keeps the flat key: every override written before this fix
   landed there (the editor showed human text and had no subject selector), so
   reading it as the human override preserves it with no migration. A non-human
   subject NEVER falls back to it — that fallback is the bug.
   `klein_improve` (+ its toggle) stays flat and global: it is a subject-agnostic
   quality instruction, identical in all five default tables. */
