/* ⬇ Save ONE generated image, and say so when it cannot be saved.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `<a href={img.url} download>`: that is one line and it lies.
 * The gallery routinely lists rows whose file has been cleaned off the disk (a
 * resume sets old saves aside, the Test Studio's trash sweeps), and an anchor
 * pointed at a missing file saves the 404 PAGE under a .png name — the user
 * finds out days later, by opening it. Fetching means the failure is a
 * sentence on screen instead of a corrupt file in Downloads.
 *
 * The name comes back on Content-Disposition. It is NOT rebuilt here: the
 * lineage scheme lives once, in services/gallery_download.py, where pytest can
 * throw hostile dataset names at it.
 *
 * No toast dependency on purpose — this hook is used from the canvas node and
 * from a viewer that also opens outside the board's toast provider, so the
 * error is returned and each host places it.
