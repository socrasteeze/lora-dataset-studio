/**
 * useCanvasStudio — the Test-Studio engine, driven from the ◉ LoRA Canvas.
 *
 * This hook does NOT reimplement the Studio. It composes the two hooks the
 * Studio already runs on and swaps exactly one thing:
 *
 *   useLoraTestStudio(anchorDataset)  → the SETTINGS payload `d`
 *                                       (models, aspects, cfg/steps choices,
 *                                        recent prompts, always-on LoRAs)
 *   useStudioRun(runId)               → the LIVE state of the launch
 *   launch()                          → POST /api/train/canvas/generate
 *                                       instead of the per-dataset route,
 *                                       because a canvas run may span datasets
 *
 * The returned object has the same shape `RunSetupPanel` already consumes
 * ({data, launch, launching, cancel, resume, deletePrompt}), which is what makes
 * the two screens the same code rather than two implementations that agree today.
 *
 * `launch` keeps the Studio's exact signature — checkpoints, strengths, seed,
 * prompt, models, aspects, cfgs, steps, steps2, count, genSettings — so the
 * global generation settings ride along untouched. The `checkpoints` argument is
 * ignored: the canvas already knows which pills were ticked, and it sends their
 * (dataset, run, step) identity rather than a bare filename.
 *
 * Deploy-then-generate lives here too: when picks are not in ComfyUI yet the
 * caller's `onDeploy` runs first, and a failure ABORTS the launch with the real
 * reason — nothing is written to someone's disk by a button that did not say so,
 * and nothing generates on half a selection.
