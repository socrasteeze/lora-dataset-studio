/* Background setup verification — the decisions, kept pure so node --test can
   drive them without a DOM.

   The problem: coming back to the app meant going through Setup again. The
   onboarding redirect keyed off a per-TAB sessionStorage flag, so a new tab, a
   new browser session or a second device re-offered the wizard on a machine
   that had been set up for weeks — and the wizard's own machine scan ran from
   scratch every time.

   The rule now: an install the server has already seen working is never
   interrupted. It re-verifies in the BACKGROUND while the user works, says so
   discreetly, and only takes over the screen when something that used to work
   has stopped. "Not everything is installed" is the normal state of nearly
   every install and must never nag — see backend/app/setup_state.py, which is
   the authority for both the verified flag and the regression list. */
