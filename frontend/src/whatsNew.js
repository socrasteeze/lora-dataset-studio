//  What's new — in-app changelog feed (source of truth)
// ============================================================================
//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//  --------------------
//  The update banner only fires on TAGGED releases. Between releases, features
//  ship silently after an "Update & restart" and users never learn they exist.
//  This file backs the in-app "What's new" panel: a short, benefit-oriented feed
//  of what changed, surfaced in the header with an unseen badge.
//
//  This is a FLOW OF NOVELTIES, not documentation. The Guide/Help registry owns
//  docs — from here, point at it with a plain URL if you want to explain rather
//  than jump. Do NOT grow a second help surface in this file.
//
//  ── HOW TO ADD AN ENTRY (do this at the tail of EVERY shipping wave) ─────────
//  Prepend a new object to the TOP of WHATS_NEW (newest first). Shape:
//
//    {
//      id:    'YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug',  // unique, stable, NEVER reused or edited
//      date:  'YYYY-MM-DD',            // ship date (drives ordering + display)
//      title: 'Benefit-first headline', // short, like a Discord announcement
//      blurb: 'One or two sentences, English, oriented on what the user gets.',
//      to:    '/settings/engines',     // OPTIONAL in-app target for "Try it →"
//    }
//
//  RULES
//  -----
//  • Write like the Discord #announcements posts: benefit-first, plain English,
//    no changelog jargon ("Added --allow-crop flag" → "Clean watermarks without
//    ever cropping the shot").
//  • `id` is a PERMANENT handle. Never change or reuse one: the "seen" marker
//    (localStorage) and the unseen badge are keyed on it. Editing an id would
//    re-flag that entry as unseen for everyone who had already read it.
//  • `date` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (zero-padded). Ordering is by date desc, then id
//    desc — so same-day entries stay stable regardless of array position.
//  • `to` is OPTIONAL. Omit it for reliability/plumbing changes with nothing to
//    click. When present it MUST be a valid in-app target (see isValidTarget):
//    a top-level route ('/studio', '/cloud', '/settings/<id>') or a dataset
//    deep-link ('/datasets?section=<id>&panel=<id>'). The section/panel ids are
//    validated against the LIVE navigation registries by whatsNew.test.js, so a
//    stale target fails the test the moment a section is renamed.
//  • Keep the list tidy: tail entries older than a couple of months can be
//    pruned once everyone has cycled through an update or two.
// =====================================================================
