// ============================================================================
//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//  --------------------
//  The update banner only fires on TAGGED releases. Between releases, features
//  ship silently after an "Update & restart" and users never learn they exist.
//  This file backs the in-app "What's new" panel: a short, benefit-oriented feed
//  of what changed, surfaced in the header with an unseen badge.
//
//  This is a FLOW OF NOVELTIES, not documentation. The Guide/Help registry owns
//  docs — from here, point at it with a plain URL if you want to explain rather
//  than jump. Do NOT grow a second help surface in this file.
//
//  ── HOW TO ADD AN ENTRY (do this at the tail of EVERY shipping wave) ─────────
//  Prepend a new object to the TOP of WHATS_NEW (newest first). Shape:
//
//    {
//      id:    'YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug',  // unique, stable, NEVER reused or edited
//      date:  'YYYY-MM-DD',            // ship date (drives ordering + display)
//      title: 'Benefit-first headline', // short, like a Discord announcement
//      blurb: 'One or two sentences, English, oriented on what the user gets.',
//      to:    '/settings/engines',     // OPTIONAL in-app target for "Try it →"
//    }
//
//  RULES
//  -----
//  • Write like the Discord #announcements posts: benefit-first, plain English,
//    no changelog jargon ("Added --allow-crop flag" → "Clean watermarks without
//    ever cropping the shot").
//  • `id` is a PERMANENT handle. Never change or reuse one: the "seen" marker
//    (localStorage) and the unseen badge are keyed on it. Editing an id would
//    re-flag that entry as unseen for everyone who had already read it.
//  • `date` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (zero-padded). Ordering is by date desc, then id
//    desc — so same-day entries stay stable regardless of array position.
//  • `to` is OPTIONAL. Omit it for reliability/plumbing changes with nothing to
//    click. When present it MUST be a valid in-app target (see isValidTarget):
//    a top-level route ('/studio', '/cloud', '/settings/<id>') or a dataset
//    deep-link ('/datasets?section=<id>&panel=<id>'). The section/panel ids are
//    validated against the LIVE navigation registries by whatsNew.test.js, so a
//    stale target fails the test the moment a section is renamed.
//  • Keep the list tidy: tail entries older than a couple of months can be
//    pruned once everyone has cycled through an update or two.

      'A picture enlarged from 512 to 2048 walks into a dataset claiming 2048, and the LoRA learns interpolated mush. The quality scan now also measures how far real detail actually goes and says so in plain pixels — "2048 px stored · ~512 px of real detail" — with a Soft detail filter for the worst of them. It is a score, not an accusation: a soft focus or a heavy denoise reads the same way, so it points you at images to look at rather than deciding for you. The same pass reads the file’s own metadata and sorts the bank by Origin into AI, Camera and Unknown — three answers, never two, because scrapers and chat apps strip metadata and a silent file is genuinely unknown, not "definitely a real photo". Two more free filters come along: Black bars for video screenshots, and the JPEG quality of the last save. All of it is plain CPU work with no extra install, and a bank you already scanned picks the new numbers up on its next Scan — no full rescan.',

Settings › Image engines gained a "Which engines to offer" card: tick the engines you actually have installed and pick which one is preselected. Krea needs its own ComfyUI node pack and four model files, so leave it unticked until Setup reports it ready — its card in the generator names whatever is still missing rather than just greying out. With both ticked you can either share the shots between them for a more varied dataset, or send every shot to both to compare them. Both are free local GPU passes, so nothing here can cost you money.

That link only exists for promotions made since the 25 July update, so older datasets will not change — those images stay blank on purpose, and Classify framing is what fills them in. It is a recovery, never a guess: an image you classified yourself is never touched, and a Bank verdict that was never worked out (or came back "unknown") leaves the image blank rather than inventing a bucket.

The cause was outside the app: Windows keeps a registry of file types that any installed program may overwrite, and once it claims the app's script bundle is plain text, the browser refuses to run it. The app no longer asks Windows what its own files are — it states the correct type for every file it serves, so the page loads whatever else is installed on your PC.

Pick Anime instead and the whole chain changes: the identity lock now protects what actually makes a character recognisable — hair colour and hairstyle, eye shape and iris colour, the signature outfit, the accessories, the distinctive marks — and it protects the art style itself, explicitly refusing to turn your character into a photograph or a 3D render. The shot catalogue is 55 drawn-media shots (bust-up, cowboy shot, expression sheet, and a front/side/back character-sheet turnaround nothing else offered), with four presets including Character sheet.

Two things worth knowing before you type: every model here must accept reference images, because the generator always sends your reference photos with the prompt; and on OpenAI, gpt-image-2 is the only model that works without organization verification — a newer slug answers 403 and that is the model talking, not your key.",

One that has CUDA but is missing OpenCLIP is refused by name rather than accepted and crashed an hour in — and nothing is ever installed into an environment the app did not create: it shows you the command and lets you decide. Typing a path yourself is a first-class route, not a fallback — point it at an interpreter or at the environment folder holding it (venv, conda, uv, a portable bundle, the system Python, another disk; spaces and accents are fine), and the app works out the rest instead of assuming a layout. No particular PyTorch or CUDA version is demanded, so an old card and a brand-new one are equally welcome. If this machine has no NVIDIA card, it is told so plainly rather than sold a CUDA install it could not use — borrowing is still offered there, purely to avoid installing the same packages twice.

A warning is never shown in red as if it were the reason, and when the log truly holds no error we say exactly that instead of pretending. RTX 50-series owners get more: the pre-flight and the failure box both detect the Blackwell trap — CUDA reports your card, training starts, then dies at the first computation because the PyTorch in your ai-toolkit venv only ships kernels up to sm_90 — and hand you the one pip command that fixes it.

Step 2 repaints whatever a crop can\'t remove, with LaMa (fast) or Klein (slower, and the only one that clears a mark on the subject). Each step shows how many images it still has to work on, so you can see how far down the funnel you are.
