// ============================================================================
//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//  --------------------
//  The update banner only fires on TAGGED releases. Between releases, features
//  ship silently after an "Update & restart" and users never learn they exist.
//  This file backs the in-app "What's new" panel: a short, benefit-oriented feed
//  of what changed, surfaced in the header with an unseen badge.
//
//  This is a FLOW OF NOVELTIES, not documentation. The Guide/Help registry owns
//  docs — from here, point at it with a plain URL if you want to explain rather
//  than jump. Do NOT grow a second help surface in this file.
//
//  ── HOW TO ADD AN ENTRY (do this at the tail of EVERY shipping wave) ─────────
//  Prepend a new object to the TOP of WHATS_NEW (newest first). Shape:
//
//    {
//      id:    'YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug',  // unique, stable, NEVER reused or edited
//      date:  'YYYY-MM-DD',            // ship date (drives ordering + display)
//      title: 'Benefit-first headline', // short, like a Discord announcement
//      blurb: 'One or two sentences, English, oriented on what the user gets.',
//      to:    '/settings/engines',     // OPTIONAL in-app target for "Try it →"
//    }
//
//  RULES
//  -----
//  • Write like the Discord #announcements posts: benefit-first, plain English,
//    no changelog jargon ("Added --allow-crop flag" → "Clean watermarks without
//    ever cropping the shot").
//  • `id` is a PERMANENT handle. Never change or reuse one: the "seen" marker
//    (localStorage) and the unseen badge are keyed on it. Editing an id would
//    re-flag that entry as unseen for everyone who had already read it.
//  • `date` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (zero-padded). Ordering is by date desc, then id
//    desc — so same-day entries stay stable regardless of array position.
//  • `to` is OPTIONAL. Omit it for reliability/plumbing changes with nothing to
//    click. When present it MUST be a valid in-app target (see isValidTarget):
//    a top-level route ('/studio', '/cloud', '/settings/<id>') or a dataset
//    deep-link ('/datasets?section=<id>&panel=<id>'). The section/panel ids are
//    validated against the LIVE navigation registries by whatsNew.test.js, so a
//    stale target fails the test the moment a section is renamed.
//  • Keep the list tidy: tail entries older than a couple of months can be
//    pruned once everyone has cycled through an update or two.

The Canvas now plays a run’s checkpoints as a timeline you can scrub, so overtraining shows up as a change you watch rather than one you reconstruct.

Two banks that share a name are one card, and only one of them ever runs, whichever machines they were sent to. The queue panel now names the machine each bank will run on and says what a waiting bank is waiting for. Separately: when a pass was skipped because the graphics card was busy, the bank card showed nothing at all — a night where every heavy pass was skipped looked exactly like a clean one.

Now the moment you pick a machine, the passes it cannot do are greyed out, unticked and unclickable, each saying which piece is missing; pick this machine again and they come straight back, ready to select. That includes captions: with another machine selected, they run there or not at all, rather than quietly coming home. The queue and the Launch button refuse the same combination too, so a stale screen gets a clear message instead of a run that fails an hour later.

Five of the seven passes now lean on the GPU you picked. The device list also says what each kind of machine can actually do: a full second install runs the bank’s heavy passes, a bare ComfyUI renders images only and cannot run them at all — and two machines that happen to share a name are finally told apart in the picker.

The mark stayed on an image for ever once it had been in a duplicate group — including on the copies you had already rejected, and on the one you kept after the others were deleted. On one bank that was 10,060 images wearing a duplicate mark under a chip that correctly read 0. The mark now asks the same question the chip does: does this group still hold two or more images you have not decided on? Rejected images still show ✕ duplicate, so you never lose the reason one was dropped, and opening an image full-screen still names its group and says whether it is resolved. Also fixed the same way: "Select all in filter" under ≈ Duplicates used to pick up every image that had ever been grouped — mostly ones you had already rejected — and now selects only what is genuinely still open.

It now counts the images across as they go — "sending images to Laptop (1240/5372)" — so you can see it moving.

    blurb:
      'This is the cause behind "I queued jobs and nothing ran for an hour" — the part the previous fixes could only soften. The database allows exactly one writer at a time, and the watermark and framing passes were taking hold of it and keeping it for about twenty seconds at a stretch, over and over, for as long as they ran. Long enough that curating another bank failed with "the database is busy", and long enough that a second machine\'s check-in timed out — which does not merely delay that machine, it drops it offline and makes it skip a turn, so its queue stopped moving too. Both passes now save in short bursts between images and hold the database only for the instant it takes to write. Creating a bank from a very large folder, the quality scan, copying images between banks and the auto-crop pass all got the same treatment, and a second machine\'s check-in now retries a busy moment instead of giving up on it. Nothing about what the passes DO has changed — every result is the same, they just stop sitting on the database while they think.',

    blurb:
      'Reported by a user whose queue sat untouched for an hour with nothing running anywhere, then again an hour later. The database has exactly one writer, and two things were making a brief collision far worse than it should have been. The worst was a read that wrote: internal flags carry an expiry, and reading an expired one deleted it — so when the writer was busy that delete failed, the flag stayed expired, and every background check retried the delete on its next tick, several times a second, from several threads at once. A short collision fed itself into a jam that would not clear. Expired flags now read as gone without writing, and the cleanup backs off the moment the database is busy. Second, the GPU reservation held during a captioning or scoring pass is kept alive by a heartbeat that also writes: it gave up at the first collision and left the reservation stuck, refusing every queued job for the rest of the pass. It now retries, and only stops for the one thing that should stop it — another pass genuinely taking the GPU. Those two causes shared a single log line and are told apart now, so a stuck reservation says which it was. Honest about the limit: this removes the app’s own ability to turn a moment of contention into a lasting one, but what holds the database for that first moment is still being tracked down.',

It did the opposite: while the other box rendered, this one refused to start anything of its own and sat idle for the whole job, up to fifteen minutes. Worse, it also refused to start a training or a vision pass, so one image on the laptop could hold up a run on the desktop. All of it now really does happen at once: two machines give you two images at a time, and a remote render no longer delays anything local. Nothing changed about what travels — generation only, and each machine still needs the models for the job it runs. Compute peers were never affected.

Being straight with you: this is a genuine change to how Klein images render, not just a fix — if you were among the few who could already generate, your results will shift a little. That is the deliberate price of everyone running the same pipeline instead of a lucky minority running one nobody else can reproduce. Two safety nets came with it: the app now checks our graphs against what YOUR ComfyUI actually offers and names any missing value (and the pack it comes from) on the Setup screen and the engine card, instead of letting you discover it mid-batch; and a test blocks any future workflow that depends on someone\'s custom nodes without saying so.

Files you already placed yourself are detected and never re-downloaded, and a download that turns out to be a login page instead of weights is now caught and deleted instead of crashing ComfyUI hours later. It stays out of “Install everything” on purpose: it is ~20 GB and Klein alone builds datasets. Setup also stops pretending Krea does not exist: it now has its own rows in the install list and counts as a capability, so the last screen says “11 of 12 ready” instead of congratulating you with “11 of 11” on a machine missing a whole engine. One thing no installer can do for you — ComfyUI only loads custom nodes when it starts, so the node pack shows “⟳ Restart ComfyUI” until you do, then the engine card turns green by itself.',

Both views now agree on the run\'s real last step, so "Continue from here" on the last pill resumes the run\'s true end — and when a save really is missing here, the message says the true reason (it lives in its cloud run: continue it from the Runs page) instead of sending you to change a setting that was never in cause.

Second: a run that goes completely silent is caught from outside itself. The run card warns as soon as a training run stops reporting, and after 45 minutes of total silence the pod is shut down automatically — checkpoints already downloaded are kept. The runtime cap is enforced from that same place, so it holds even if the run\'s own supervision died. Phases that are quiet by design — booting, uploading, downloading the result — are never cut.

On a machine that has one, that meant hours: nearly three of them on a 30 000-image bank. But if you train LoRAs or run ComfyUI, this machine already has a proven CUDA PyTorch sitting right there. Score can now use it — no download, no second install. Open a bank, and where the CPU warning appears click "Use a GPU Python I already have": the app checks the interpreters it knows about (ai-toolkit, ComfyUI, its own) and tells you, package by package, which ones can really run the pass. One that has CUDA but is missing OpenCLIP is refused by name rather than accepted and crashed an hour in — and nothing is ever installed into an environment the app did not create: it shows you the command and lets you decide. Typing a path yourself is a first-class route, not a fallback — point it at an interpreter or at the environment folder holding it (venv, conda, uv, a portable bundle, the system Python, another disk; spaces and accents are fine), and the app works out the rest instead of assuming a layout. No particular PyTorch or CUDA version is demanded, so an old card and a brand-new one are equally welcome. If this machine has no NVIDIA card, it is told so plainly rather than sold a CUDA install it could not use — borrowing is still offered there, purely to avoid installing the same packages twice. And if you never open the dialog, nothing changes: it is an offer, never a prerequisite. Re-check after installing something, and go back to the app default whenever you like.',

Hit “🏷️ Caption” to describe every not-yet-captioned image, or select some first to caption just those — it runs in the background, is Stop-able mid-run, and never races your GPU. The captions then power a new 🔍 search bar: type “red dress” and the grid filters to matching images (it matches file names too), combinable with every existing filter — the fast way to find shots in a 9,000-image Telegram export. Best of all, captions follow the images: promote a captioned selection and the dataset starts already captioned for them.",

New filter chips, style groups and a per-subfolder scope let you slice a Telegram export by chat; every threshold lives in Settings → Captioning & quality and re-sorts the bank with no rescan.

It backs up your current files, swaps in the new ones — keeping your datasets, settings, .env and Python environment fully intact — then restarts.
