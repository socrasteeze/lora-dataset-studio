//  🎁 What's new — in-app changelog feed (source of truth)
// =====================================================================
//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//  --------------------
//  The update banner only fires on TAGGED releases. Between releases, features
//  ship silently after an "Update & restart" and users never learn they exist.
//  This file backs the in-app "What's new" panel: a short, benefit-oriented feed
//  of what changed, surfaced in the header with an unseen badge.
//
//  This is a FLOW OF NOVELTIES, not documentation. The Guide/Help registry owns
//  docs — from here, point at it with a plain URL if you want to explain rather
//  than jump. Do NOT grow a second help surface in this file.
//
//  ── HOW TO ADD AN ENTRY (do this at the tail of EVERY shipping wave) ─────────
//  Prepend a new object to the TOP of WHATS_NEW (newest first). Shape:
//
//    {
//      id:    'YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug',  // unique, stable, NEVER reused or edited
//      date:  'YYYY-MM-DD',            // ship date (drives ordering + display)
//      title: 'Benefit-first headline', // short, like a Discord announcement
//      blurb: 'One or two sentences, English, oriented on what the user gets.',
//      to:    '/settings/engines',     // OPTIONAL in-app target for "Try it →"
//    }
//
//  RULES
//  -----
//  • Write like the Discord #announcements posts: benefit-first, plain English,
//    no changelog jargon ("Added --allow-crop flag" → "Clean watermarks without
//    ever cropping the shot").
//  • `id` is a PERMANENT handle. Never change or reuse one: the "seen" marker
//    (localStorage) and the unseen badge are keyed on it. Editing an id would
//    re-flag that entry as unseen for everyone who had already read it.
//  • `date` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (zero-padded). Ordering is by date desc, then id
//    desc — so same-day entries stay stable regardless of array position.
//  • `to` is OPTIONAL. Omit it for reliability/plumbing changes with nothing to
//    click. When present it MUST be a valid in-app target (see isValidTarget):
//    a top-level route ('/studio', '/cloud', '/settings/<id>') or a dataset
//    deep-link ('/datasets?section=<id>&panel=<id>'). The section/panel ids are
//    validated against the LIVE navigation registries by whatsNew.test.js, so a
//    stale target fails the test the moment a section is renamed.
//  • `image` is OPTIONAL: a repo-relative path to a screenshot
//    ('docs/screenshots/canvas/board.png'). It is shown in the GITHUB RELEASE
//    body only — the in-app panel does not render it — under the prose, pinned
//    to the released tag so an old release keeps showing what actually shipped.
//    Three rules, and they are not style preferences:
//      1. ONE per release, on the headline change. A wall of screenshots reads
//         as a brochure; one picture reads as evidence.
//      2. NEVER from a real bank or dataset. The maintainer's own images are
//         NSFW and are out of bounds for anything public, cropped or not — use
//         the showcase instance (scripts/seed_showcase.py) whose data is
//         generated.
//      3. COMMIT THE PICTURE BEFORE YOU TAG. The URL is pinned to the tag,
//         so the file has to exist inside it — a screenshot added after the
//         release is a dead link, and a published release cannot be fixed
//         by attaching one. Order: shoot, commit, tag, release. (Measured:
//         v2026.08.22 and v2026.08.18 both carry no docs/screenshots/release/
//         folder at all, so neither could be retrofitted.)
//      4. Prefer a screen that shows the CHANGE, not the app. A settings panel,
//         a toolbar, a queue — those photograph without any dataset image at
//         all, which is why most entries can carry one cheaply.
//      5. WIRE THE `image:` FIELD BEFORE THE TAG, on an entry that is NEW in
//         that tag. The notes select new ids only, so a picture wired onto an
//         already-shipped entry never appears anywhere. This is not
//         hypothetical: v2026.08.23 went out imageless with the mechanism
//         landed AND the PNG committed — nobody had written the one field
//         line. release-notes-contract.test.mjs now fails on an orphan
//         screenshot, so the miss is loud instead of silent.
//  • Keep the list tidy: entries whose release has LONG shipped move to
//    frontend/src/whatsNewArchive.js — their own lazy chunk, loaded by the
//    panel's "Show older updates". NEVER archive an entry that has not been
//    in a tagged release yet: release notes are built from THIS file's id
//    diff, so archiving an unshipped entry silently costs it its notes.
//    `id`/`date` move unchanged (the seen-marker keys on ids); `to:` is
//    dropped on the way (months-old targets go stale, and no `to` keeps the
//    archive import-free). whatsNewArchive.test.js holds the pairing.

    title: 'Find the shots that are secretly two shots',
    blurb:
      'Shot detection cuts on a change big enough to see. The ones it misses are the soft ones — a dissolve, a match cut, a new angle inside the same room — and each one leaves behind a “shot” that is really two scenes. It is the worst kind of training example, because it teaches the model a transition nobody asked for, and you cannot catch it by scrolling: the thumbnail is one of the two halves and looks perfectly fine. The 🎬 Video bank now checks every shot for this by itself, at the end of 🔎 Find scenes, and it costs nothing at all — no decoding, no model, no GPU, no button. It compares a shot’s first frame to its last using vectors that pass already cached, so a bank you embedded weeks ago gets its reading by clicking 🔎 Find scenes again. Each shot gains a scene coherence number (1.00 means its ends are the same picture), and 🎚 Quality cuts gains a Scene coherence floor that flags anything below it as “Cut inside the shot” — then ✂ Split here does the repair. Empty by default, and the Guide is blunt about why: this is a ranking, not a verdict. Measured against shots of the same length, a cut at 0.80 catches about a third of the double shots and flags about one honest shot in seven, so use it to choose what to look at first. Long takes score lower whether or not anything was cut, which the panel says out loud.',

    blurb:
      'A video LoRA learns camera language along with everything else, and until now there was no way to see any of it: a bank of a thousand shots gave you no answer to “which of these are locked off” or “where are the handheld ones”. The 🎬 Video bank has a new 🎥 Camera pass. It tracks every frame of every shot and labels what the camera did — pan left, pan right, pan up, pan down, zoom in, zoom out, static shot, handheld shot — using the same words the video trainer itself uses, so a label here means the same thing there. Three more are ours: rolling, slideshow (a photograph panned across rather than filmed) and subject moves. The labels appear on each thumbnail and as a new 🎥 Camera row of filters above the gallery, which composes with the ⚑ flag chips — “shaky shots that also pan right” is one click each. Nothing is ever rejected: these are descriptions, not faults, because the wobble one person is filtering out is exactly what the next person is training on. If you do want to cut on it, 🎚 Quality cuts gains a Camera shake threshold, empty by default like the rest. The pass runs on the CPU at about fifteen times real time and needs only the video decode extra, which now installs OpenCV alongside PyAV — press Install on the video row in Setup if it shows a ✗. Honest limits, stated in the app too: a pivot and a slide look identical in a flat picture so both are called a pan, orbits are not detected at all, and a real pan across a wall or a horizon can read as a slideshow because it has no depth either.',

    blurb:
      'A two-hour rush becomes three hundred shots, and until now judging them meant three gestures each: click a tile, click ✓ or ✕, come back to the grid. The 🎬 Video bank has a new ⌨ Burst mode above the gallery. Turn it on and one tile carries a cursor — K keeps it, R rejects it, P puts it back to untriaged, S or → moves on without deciding, ← steps back. They are the same keys as the image bank\'s ▶ Review, so the reflex you already have works here. The cursor then jumps to the next shot you have NOT judged yet, which on a half-triaged bank is most of the speed; untick Auto-advance and it stays put so K then R corrects the same shot. It never wraps silently: when nothing untriaged is left ahead, the bar says how many are still behind you and Home goes back to the first. U undoes the last decision and moves the cursor onto that shot so you can see what it fixed, ten steps deep, always restoring what the shot actually was before — undoing a reject on a shot you had kept puts the keep back. The offer sits in the bar rather than in a toast, because at one keystroke a second a toast is replaced before it can be read. Your keys never wait for the network either: the tile flips at once and the decisions are sent behind you, one request at a time, with a run of identical verdicts going out as a single batch and a "saving N…" counter so a run that has ended is never mistaken for a run that is saved.

The 🎬 Video bank has a new 🤖 AI check: it looks at two contiguous seconds of each shot and measures how erratically the motion changes, because real footage is full of small irregularities and generated footage tends to be smoother than the world. Shots that come out suspiciously smooth get a “May be AI-generated” chip, against a new cut in 🎚 Quality cuts that is empty by default and applied as you move it with nothing rescanned.

Three new cuts in the thresholds panel — letterbox share, burned-in text share, usable frame floor — all empty by default, all applied as you move them with nothing rescanned.

      'The watermark detector is very good, but it is a classifier — some marks, especially the ones stock sites tile across a whole photo, score under any threshold you set. Until now that was a dead end: the mask editor only opened on images the scan had already flagged. Now you can open it on any image you are looking at, in a Dataset or a Bank, and the zones you draw become the flag — 🧽 Clean then repaints exactly what you drew. Changed your mind about an image you had ruled a false positive? Drawing on it takes that back too.',
