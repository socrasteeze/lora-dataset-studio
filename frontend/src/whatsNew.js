// ============================================================================
//  What's new — in-app changelog feed (source of truth)
// ============================================================================
//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//  --------------------
//  The update banner only fires on TAGGED releases. Between releases, features
//  ship silently after an "Update & restart" and users never learn they exist.
//  This file backs the in-app "What's new" panel: a short, benefit-oriented feed
//  of what changed, surfaced in the header with an unseen badge.
//
//  This is a FLOW OF NOVELTIES, not documentation. The Guide/Help registry owns
//  docs — from here, point at it with a plain URL if you want to explain rather
//  than jump. Do NOT grow a second help surface in this file.
//
//  ── HOW TO ADD AN ENTRY (do this at the tail of EVERY shipping wave) ─────────
//  Prepend a new object to the TOP of WHATS_NEW (newest first). Shape:
//
//    {
//      id:    'YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug',  // unique, stable, NEVER reused or edited
//      date:  'YYYY-MM-DD',            // ship date (drives ordering + display)
//      title: 'Benefit-first headline', // short, like a Discord announcement
//      blurb: 'One or two sentences, English, oriented on what the user gets.',
//      to:    '/settings/engines',     // OPTIONAL in-app target for "Try it →"
//    }
//
//  RULES
//  -----
//  • Write like the Discord #announcements posts: benefit-first, plain English,
//    no changelog jargon ("Added --allow-crop flag" → "Clean watermarks without
//    ever cropping the shot").
//  • `id` is a PERMANENT handle. Never change or reuse one: the "seen" marker
//    (localStorage) and the unseen badge are keyed on it. Editing an id would
//    re-flag that entry as unseen for everyone who had already read it.
//  • `date` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (zero-padded). Ordering is by date desc, then id
//    desc — so same-day entries stay stable regardless of array position.
//  • `to` is OPTIONAL. Omit it for reliability/plumbing changes with nothing to
//    click. When present it MUST be a valid in-app target (see isValidTarget):
//    a top-level route ('/studio', '/cloud', '/settings/<id>') or a dataset
//    deep-link ('/datasets?section=<id>&panel=<id>'). The section/panel ids are
//    validated against the LIVE navigation registries by whatsNew.test.js, so a
//    stale target fails the test the moment a section is renamed.
//  • Keep the list tidy: tail entries older than a couple of months can be
//    pruned once everyone has cycled through an update or two.
// =====================================================================

      "The Bank gains three new triage passes for a big mixed dump. “Score” rates every image for aesthetics (1–10) with the LAION predictor, flags NSFW, and groups shots by visual STYLE (screenshots and memes cluster apart from photoreal) — and “keep best” on a duplicate group now keeps the nicest-looking copy, not just the biggest. “Find watermarks” reuses the same Qwen3-VL detector the datasets use to flag overlaid logos/URLs (detection only — your files are never touched). New filter chips, style groups and a per-subfolder scope let you slice a Telegram export by chat; every threshold lives in Settings → Captioning & quality and re-sorts the bank with no rescan. The scoring model installs on demand from Setup ▸ Quality tools; without it the button explains what to install rather than failing silently.",

It backs up your current files, swaps in the new ones — keeping your datasets, settings, .env and Python environment fully intact — then restarts.

Your API keys and tokens are deliberately left out, so the file is safe to keep around; re-enter them once on the new install. Restoring is the same “Import backup” button: it now accepts the master archive too, rebuilds every dataset without ever overwriting one (name clashes get a “(restored)” suffix), and — new — brings back each dataset’s training runs so it lands under “Trained” again instead of “Not trained yet”, with its history in the Runs hub. Tick “Include trained LoRAs” before backing up to bundle the trained .safetensors themselves (a much larger file); leave it off and the light training history still restores your “Trained” status.
