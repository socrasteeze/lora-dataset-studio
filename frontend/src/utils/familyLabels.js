/* How the app NAMES a training family, in one place.

   It used to live inside lineageChrome.jsx. The LoRA Canvas has to name families
   in a JSX-free helper — the refusal to mix Krea and Z-Image in one run has to
   SAY which two families were mixed, and `node --test` cannot parse JSX — so the
   map moved here and lineageChrome re-exports it. One table, no drift. */
