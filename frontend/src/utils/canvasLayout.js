/* Pure geometry for the ◉ LoRA Canvas — the board that puts EVERY dataset's
   lineage on one surface.

   Framework-free (no JSX, no DOM) so `node --test` exercises the real arithmetic
   the screen uses: stacking the datasets into lanes, fitting the board into its
   frame, and the zoom/pan bookkeeping. The renderer lives in
   components/canvas/LineageCanvas.jsx and imports exactly these functions — it
   owns no second copy of the maths.

   Two coordinate systems, and mixing them is the classic canvas bug:
     • WORLD  — the board's own units. A dataset lane is laid out here by
                utils/lineageGraph.js, untouched and unaware of zoom.
     • SCREEN — pixels inside the frame. screen = world * scale + translate.
   Every function below states which one it takes.

   Slice 1 has no per-node placement: lanes stack in the order given, each at
   x = 0. Node dragging and its remembered positions are slice 2's Placement
   layer, which will sit BETWEEN lineageGraph.js and this file — this module
   only ever consumes finished per-lane sizes, so it does not have to change
   when that layer arrives. */

 * Stack per-dataset graphs into vertical lanes.
 *
 * `entries` — [{ datasetId, name, width, height, minX, minY, ... }] in the order
 * they should appear (the caller decides; the canvas keeps the filter's order).
 * A lane with no measurable graph still gets its header, so a dataset that is
 * still loading — or whose runs all vanished — keeps its place on the board
 * instead of making the lanes below it jump when it arrives.
 *
 * `minX`/`minY` are that lane's OVERHANG: how far its content reaches above or
 * left of its own origin, never positive (utils/canvasImageNodes.imageNodeExtent).
 * A pinned picture may be parked above its lane, and the world has to contain it
 * or ✦ Fit frames a board with something floating off the top of it.
 *
 * Returns { lanes, x, y, width, height } in WORLD units — the board's BOX, whose
 * top-left `x`/`y` may be negative. Each lane carries `y` (its header's top) and
 * `graphY` (its graph's top).
 *
 * ⚠️ The overhang does NOT push a lane down, and lanes are NOT shifted right to
 * make room for a left overhang. Both were tried on paper and both are the same
 * bug: a picture dragged one pixel past its lane's corner would move every lane
 * on the board, so the whole thing would slide sideways under the hand still
 * dragging it. Lanes keep the positions they always had; only the box that Fit
 * measures grows to include what hangs out of them. With no overhang anywhere,
 * this returns exactly the numbers it always returned, with x = y = 0.
