/* Pure geometry for the ◉ LoRA Canvas — the board that puts EVERY dataset's
   lineage on one surface.

   Framework-free (no JSX, no DOM) so `node --test` exercises the real arithmetic
   the screen uses: stacking the datasets into lanes, fitting the board into its
   frame, and the zoom/pan bookkeeping. The renderer lives in
   components/canvas/LineageCanvas.jsx and imports exactly these functions — it
   owns no second copy of the maths.

   Two coordinate systems, and mixing them is the classic canvas bug:
     • WORLD  — the board's own units. A dataset lane is laid out here by
                utils/lineageGraph.js, untouched and unaware of zoom.
     • SCREEN — pixels inside the frame. screen = world * scale + translate.
   Every function below states which one it takes.

   Slice 1 has no per-node placement: lanes stack in the order given, each at
   x = 0. Node dragging and its remembered positions are slice 2's Placement
   layer, which will sit BETWEEN lineageGraph.js and this file — this module
   only ever consumes finished per-lane sizes, so it does not have to change
   when that layer arrives. */
