/* Grouped pinned images on the ◉ LoRA Canvas — the arithmetic.

   Asked for: "drop one image node onto another and they become ONE node, with
   the pictures side by side and NO border between them; no limit on how many I
   add; and to take one out I just drag it outside the node."

   ── What a group IS (the decision everything else hangs off) ────────────────
   A group is NOT a new kind of node holding N pictures. It is a MEMBERSHIP
   carried by pictures that stay ordinary nodes: one row each, exactly as
   before, plus `groupId` and `groupPos`. Three reasons, in order of weight:

     • the promise already made. "Close an image and re-open it from its gallery
       and it comes back where and how big you left it" is a PER-IMAGE promise
       held by a per-image row (canvas_image_node, `visible: false` + geometry).
       A container node would have to keep a shadow copy of every member's
       geometry to keep that promise — the same data, in a second place, free to
       disagree. Here the remembered box IS the stored box, grouped or not;
       joining a group never touches it.
     • taking one out is then a two-field write (groupId := null), not the
       splitting of a container.
     • each picture keeps its OWN actions — , ✕, and whatever the chrome gains
       next. A container that swallowed its members would have to re-invent
       every one of them, per member, and get "which one am I closing?" right
       from scratch.

   The strip is therefore DERIVED, never stored: `layoutImageNodes` turns the
   flat list into singles and groups, and the component only draws the numbers.
   That is what makes all of this testable without a DOM — `node --test` cannot
   parse JSX, and the parts that age badly are exactly these: which node a drop
   lands on, what order the strip ends up in, what a leaver gets back, and what
   the ones staying behind keep.

   Coordinates are LANE-LOCAL world units, like everything else on this board.

   ⚠ Both new fields are ADDITIVE, nullable, and never rename anything: a lane
   loaded from a database that predates them reads `null` everywhere and draws
   exactly the board it drew before. */
