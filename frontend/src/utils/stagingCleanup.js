   Two facts drive everything here:
     • cleaning moves a staging folder to the app's TRASH, which lives on the SAME
       disk — so "62.6 GB moved to the trash" frees nothing until the trash is
       emptied in Settings. Every message says so; hiding it is what made the
       global button look broken;
     • the per-run 🧹 must spare EXACTLY what the global purge spares (active runs,
       and pods kept for manual recovery), so the two can never disagree. That
       rule lives once, here, mirroring the backend's staging_spare_reason(). */
