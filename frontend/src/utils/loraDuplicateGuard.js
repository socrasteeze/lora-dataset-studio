/** The preset row that names a LoRA the engine ALREADY loads — predicted in the
 *  editor, where the row is written, instead of only in the server log.
 *
 *  Both local engines pin one LoRA outside the presets: Klein chains
 *  `klein.consistency_lora` at `klein.consistency_strength`, Krea loads
 *  `krea.identity_lora` at `krea.identity_lora_strength`. A preset row naming
 *  that same file is DROPPED by the backend on purpose — chaining the identical
 *  LoRA twice sums both strengths into one delta well past what the file was
 *  trained for (measured as visible macro-blocking; reported by @waltm on
 *  Discord). See klein_edit_helper.build_workflow and
 *  krea_edit_helper._existing_generation_lora_rows.
 *
 *  Until now that drop happened in silence: nothing on screen, one warning line
 *  in the server log. A user who had written exactly one preset row, and had
 *  written the consistency LoRA into it, got a run with no extra LoRA at all and
 *  no reason why — which reads as "the app ignores my settings".
 *
 *  This module exists so the FRONT PREDICTS EXACTLY WHAT THE BACK WILL DO.
 *  The backend compares `os.path.normcase(os.path.normpath(a)) ==
 *  os.path.normcase(os.path.normpath(b))`, so a '/' instead of a '\\', a
 *  doubled separator, a './' segment or a difference of case must NOT dodge the
 *  warning — otherwise the editor says "fine" about a row the server discards.
 *
 *  Case: the comparison here is always case-insensitive, while `normcase` is a
 *  no-op on a POSIX server. That is deliberate and it does not over-promise: on
 *  a case-sensitive filesystem a case-different spelling names a file that is
 *  not on disk, and the row is dropped anyway ("not found under any loras root
 *  — skipped"). The row is ignored either way; only the log's reason differs,
 *  which is why the warning says the row is ignored rather than naming a
 *  mechanism it cannot know.
 *
 *  What it deliberately does NOT claim: an ABSOLUTE path aliasing the same file
 *  (Klein resolves preset rows through resolve_model_ref before comparing, so
 *  the server can catch a case the front cannot). Missing a warning is a much
 *  smaller failure than inventing one.
