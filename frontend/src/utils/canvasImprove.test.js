/* ✨ Upscale & improve on the ◉ Canvas board — the decision, and the wiring that
   carries it to two of the shared lightbox's three hosts: the board, and the
   checkpoint / run gallery the result is delivered to. The third (a pill's
   preview) must gain nothing, which is asserted here and again in the DOM in
   tests/gallery-improve-render.test.mjs.

   The expensive bug this file guards is not visual. The board's pictures are
   `lora_test_image` rows and the dataset improve route resolves a
   `face_dataset_image`: two tables, two independent id spaces. Wiring the board
   to the dataset route does not throw, does not 404, and improves a real but
   UNRELATED picture. So the route is asserted here character by character. */
