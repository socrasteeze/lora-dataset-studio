/* Pin ALL the images a run just produced onto the ◉ LoRA Canvas, in one go.

   A finished generation says "5 images ready" and names the checkpoints they
   joined. Getting them onto the board meant opening each of those galleries and
   pinning the pictures one by one — for a lot spanning four runs, four panels
   and five gestures to see the thing the run was fired to let you see.

   This module is the whole decision layer of the one-click version. Pure, no
   JSX and no DOM, because `node --test` cannot parse JSX and the part that
   decides whether the feature is usable is geometry, not markup.

   ⚠ EVERYTHING HERE IS IN BOARD UNITS, never in screen pixels. The board is
   zoomable (a real board is often read at 24 %); a rule written in pixels would
   be right at one zoom level and wrong at every other one.

   ── The placement, and why this one ──────────────────────────────────────────

   The requirement is not "tidy", it is "nothing may ever be on top of anything
   else" — a lot dropped onto a board that already carries cards, checkpoint
   pills and hand-placed pictures. Three candidates were on the table: a spiral
   around each source, a free-space search from the source's own spot, and a
   band under the tree. The first two share one flaw: they place INTO the tree,
   so they can only work by searching around obstacles, and the result reads as
   scatter — you cannot tell at a glance which picture came from which run, which
   is the only reason to put them on the board at all.

   So: a CONTACT-SHEET BAND below the lane, one COLUMN per source checkpoint,
   each column starting at the x of its own source and sliding right until it
   finds a free column.

     • no overlap is structural, not searched for: the band starts below the
       lowest thing already on the lane, and inside the band each column is
       reserved before it is filled. There is no case where a tile is placed
       "hopefully";
     • a source's images are a vertical stack under that source, so a lot from
       four runs reads as four groups without a legend — and the connector each
       node already draws to its own pill (utils/canvasImageNodes.imageNodeEdges)
       confirms it;
     • it is trivially deterministic — no search order to depend on.

   The cost, stated: a picture is BELOW the tree rather than beside its card, so
   on a deep lineage it is further from its pill than a single hand-pin would
   be. That is the trade the requirement asks for; a pin dropped by hand still
   lands beside its card (defaultImageSpot), which is unchanged.

   ── When there is no room ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Structurally, there always is: the band grows down and right, outside
   everything, and the lane grows with it (imageNodeExtent). So the only bound
   is a deliberate one — PIN_BATCH_MAX — and it is REPORTED, never silent. A lot
   over the cap places the cap and says how many it left out and where to get
   them. Nothing is ever stacked quietly. */

/**
 * ✦ Tidy up, for the side-by-side STRIPS of one lane: bring each one back
 * beside the run that made it, WITHOUT taking it apart.
 *
 * ── Why strips move at all now ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * They used to be left exactly where they were, and the argument was sound
 * while a picture could not leave its lane: a strip is something the user
 * assembled on purpose, and re-flowing its members one by one would not tidy it,
 * it would dismantle it. Free placement changes the stakes, not the argument.
 * A strip can now be parked thousands of units above or left of everything, and
 * "the button that rebuilds the board" leaving it out there would mean a whole
 * assembled comparison with no way back short of finding it by hand at 10 %
 * zoom. So the strip comes back — as ONE object, which is the thing the old
 * argument was actually protecting.
 *
 * ── How ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only the ANCHOR's row is written. The strip is DERIVED from the anchor's spot
 * (utils/canvasImageGroups.layoutImageNodes), so moving the anchor moves the
 * band, and every member keeps the geometry it gets back the day it is dragged
 * out. The group fields are deliberately NOT in the returned rows either: a
 * write that only mentions geometry can never dissolve a group, so a half-failed
 * tidy leaves a strip moved, never broken.
 *
 * Placed through the SAME rule a hand-dropped pin uses — beside its own card,
 * sliding down past whatever is already there (canvasImageNodes.spotBesideCard
 * / slideBelow) — measured on `occupiedBox`, so the strip's drag BAR is
 * reserved too and the contact-sheet band placed afterwards cannot land on it.
 *
 * `taken` are extra boxes already spoken for; the lane's own run cards are added
 * here rather than asked for, so a caller cannot forget them and drop a strip on
 * a card. Returns { rows, boxes }: the rows to persist, and the footprints the
 * STRIPS now occupy — exactly the shape `placeImageBatch` wants as `existing`,
 * so the contact-sheet band placed next cannot disagree about what is free.
 * (The cards are not in `boxes`: `placeImageBatch` reads those off the graph
 * itself, and publishing them twice would only make its tests lie.)
