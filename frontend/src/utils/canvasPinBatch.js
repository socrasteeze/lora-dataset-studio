/* Pin ALL the images a run just produced onto the ◉ LoRA Canvas, in one go.

   A finished generation says "5 images ready" and names the checkpoints they
   joined. Getting them onto the board meant opening each of those galleries and
   pinning the pictures one by one — for a lot spanning four runs, four panels
   and five gestures to see the thing the run was fired to let you see.

   This module is the whole decision layer of the one-click version. Pure, no
   JSX and no DOM, because `node --test` cannot parse JSX and the part that
   decides whether the feature is usable is geometry, not markup.

   ⚠ EVERYTHING HERE IS IN BOARD UNITS, never in screen pixels. The board is
   zoomable (a real board is often read at 24 %); a rule written in pixels would
   be right at one zoom level and wrong at every other one.

   ── The placement, and why this one ──────────────────────────────────────────

   The requirement is not "tidy", it is "nothing may ever be on top of anything
   else" — a lot dropped onto a board that already carries cards, checkpoint
   pills and hand-placed pictures. Three candidates were on the table: a spiral
   around each source, a free-space search from the source's own spot, and a
   band under the tree. The first two share one flaw: they place INTO the tree,
   so they can only work by searching around obstacles, and the result reads as
   scatter — you cannot tell at a glance which picture came from which run, which
   is the only reason to put them on the board at all.

   So: a CONTACT-SHEET BAND below the lane, one COLUMN per source checkpoint,
   each column starting at the x of its own source and sliding right until it
   finds a free column.

     • no overlap is structural, not searched for: the band starts below the
       lowest thing already on the lane, and inside the band each column is
       reserved before it is filled. There is no case where a tile is placed
       "hopefully";
     • a source's images are a vertical stack under that source, so a lot from
       four runs reads as four groups without a legend — and the connector each
       node already draws to its own pill (utils/canvasImageNodes.imageNodeEdges)
       confirms it;
     • it is trivially deterministic — no search order to depend on.

   The cost, stated: a picture is BELOW the tree rather than beside its card, so
   on a deep lineage it is further from its pill than a single hand-pin would
   be. That is the trade the requirement asks for; a pin dropped by hand still
   lands beside its card (defaultImageSpot), which is unchanged.

   ── When there is no room ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Structurally, there always is: the band grows down and right, outside
   everything, and the lane grows with it (imageNodeExtent). So the only bound
   is a deliberate one — PIN_BATCH_MAX — and it is REPORTED, never silent. A lot
   over the cap places the cap and says how many it left out and where to get
   them. Nothing is ever stacked quietly. */

 * WHICH LAUNCH made a picture — the identity two grids must never share.

 * A grid is ONE CLICK ON GENERATE. `lora_test_image.run_id` already groups
 * every cell of one launch (it is what a run resumes from), `prompt` separates
 * the grids inside a launch that fired several, and `record_id` names the LoRA,
 * which is also the LANE the grid has to live in — a strip cannot span two
 * datasets, they are drawn as separate bands.
 *
 * `step` is deliberately NOT in the key. Tick four epochs, click once, and the
 * four pictures that come back are ONE grid: that click is the thing you are
 * looking at, and its four renders are what you are comparing. The grid then
 * straddles the four band columns rather than filling one, which is the price,
 * and it was chosen with that price on the table.
 *
 * ── Why this keeps being rewritten, and what actually settles it ─────────────
 *
 * Fourth rewrite in five days (18/08 twice, 21/08, 22/08), because LAUNCH and
 * CHECKPOINT are orthogonal and a grid can only follow one of them:
 *
 *   • by CHECKPOINT (21/08 → 22/08), every picture a checkpoint ever made piles
 *     into one grid forever. Regenerating appends to the grid already there and
 *     there is NO gesture that says "this is a new lot" — which is the report
 *     this key answers, and the same thing `_gallery_image` has documented on
 *     the backend's `run_id` all along: without the launch, two runs fired at
 *     one checkpoint are indistinguishable and the board shows one lot where
 *     there were two.
 *   • by LAUNCH (here), a click that renders ONE picture per checkpoint leaves
 *     loose tiles instead of a grid, because a grid of one is not a grid. That
 *     was the 21/08 complaint, and it is the accepted cost: a lot is still a
 *     lot when it is spread thin, and the board already lays those tiles in
 *     their checkpoint's column, in training order.
 *
 * What settles it is that only one of the two is a FACT about the picture the
 * user performed: they clicked Generate once. The checkpoint is a fact about
 * the picture's provenance, and the board already expresses provenance in the
 * PLACEMENT — one band column per checkpoint, training order. Membership says
 * what you made; placement says what made it. They were fighting over one
 * channel; they get one each.
 *
 * Accumulating across launches on purpose is still possible and is now the
 * gesture it should always have been: drop one pinned picture onto another to
 * fuse them. A rule cannot know you wanted those two lots together; a drag
 * says so.
 *
 * An image made before the run column was backfilled carries no run id and
 * falls back to its checkpoint, so a board that predates all of this keeps
 * drawing what it drew rather than silently regrouping itself. A picture with
 * neither identity has NO key and stays a loose tile, rather than being fused
 * into somebody else's grid on a guess.

/** Turn freshly pinned images into (or append them to) one strip per LAUNCH

 * that click, so it belongs with the rest of that click. Pin all used to have

 * the tail of a launch parked a rival grid beside the head of it instead of
 * joining — the whole reason there is now one function, and it still matters
 * under this key: a launch is very often pinned in more than one go.
 *
 * ⚠️ What is JOINED and what is not follows entirely from the key. An existing

/**
 * ✦ Tidy up, for the side-by-side STRIPS of one lane: bring each one back
 * beside the run that made it, WITHOUT taking it apart.
 *
 * ── Why strips move at all now ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * They used to be left exactly where they were, and the argument was sound
 * while a picture could not leave its lane: a strip is something the user
 * assembled on purpose, and re-flowing its members one by one would not tidy it,
 * it would dismantle it. Free placement changes the stakes, not the argument.
 * A strip can now be parked thousands of units above or left of everything, and
 * "the button that rebuilds the board" leaving it out there would mean a whole
 * assembled comparison with no way back short of finding it by hand at 10 %
 * zoom. So the strip comes back — as ONE object, which is the thing the old
 * argument was actually protecting.
 *
 * ── How ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only the ANCHOR's row is written. The strip is DERIVED from the anchor's spot
 * (utils/canvasImageGroups.layoutImageNodes), so moving the anchor moves the
 * band, and every member keeps the geometry it gets back the day it is dragged
 * out. The group fields are deliberately NOT in the returned rows either: a
 * write that only mentions geometry can never dissolve a group, so a half-failed
 * tidy leaves a strip moved, never broken.
 *
 * Placed through the SAME rule a hand-dropped pin uses — beside its own card,
 * sliding down past whatever is already there (canvasImageNodes.spotBesideCard
 * / slideBelow) — measured on `occupiedBox`, so the strip's drag BAR is
 * reserved too and the contact-sheet band placed afterwards cannot land on it.
 *
 * `taken` are extra boxes already spoken for; the lane's own run cards are added
 * here rather than asked for, so a caller cannot forget them and drop a strip on
 * a card. Returns { rows, boxes }: the rows to persist, and the footprints the
 * STRIPS now occupy — exactly the shape `placeImageBatch` wants as `existing`,
 * so the contact-sheet band placed next cannot disagree about what is free.
 * (The cards are not in `boxes`: `placeImageBatch` reads those off the graph
 * itself, and publishing them twice would only make its tests lie.)

/**
 * The entries the LANE STACK is built from (utils/canvasLayout.stackLanes) —

 *
 * Lives here, out of the component, for one reason: this is where the promise
 * "a drag moves no lane" is either kept or quietly lost, and `node --test`
 * cannot parse JSX. The wiring below is the whole fix, so the wiring is what
 * the test drives.
 *
 * ── The two lists, and why they must NOT be the same one ─────────────────────
 * `layoutByLane` is what the lane DRAWS this frame: the picture under the hand
 * sits where the hand is, at the size it is being given, pulled out of its
 * strip if it is on its way out. The REACH (minX/minY/maxX/maxY) is measured on
 * it, and must be — ✦ Fit, 📷 Export and the pan clamp all have to reach a
 * picture while it is still moving.
 *
 * `restingByLane` is the lane's COMMITTED rows — the board as it would reload.
 * The stacking height is measured on it, and only on it. `tidyLaneReach` was
 * written to be position-independent, and it is; but it is not, and cannot be,
 * gesture-independent, because ✦ Tidy up's layout depends on how many strips a
 * lane has, how many members each one holds, and how many loose pictures go in
 * the contact-sheet band — and a drag changes all three, live. Measured on a
 * three-member strip whose anchor is dragged out: the reserve went 576 → 1143
 * mid-gesture, shoving the next dataset 567 units down the board while the
 * hand was still moving. Pulling the drag OUT of this input is what freezes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ The lane still settles ONCE on release, and that is not the bug: a picture
 * that has genuinely left its strip is a membership change, so the lane really
 * does need a different amount of room for the button to have somewhere to put
 * it. What nothing may do is move a lane while the gesture is still in flight.
 *
 * ── …and the same rule for the RUN CARDS ────────────────────────────────────
 * `stackPlaced` carries each lane's AUTOMATIC tree — the layout the lane has
 * before anybody moved anything — and the stacking height is read from there.
 *
 * Freezing it for the duration of the gesture was not enough, and the second
 * report says why: "dragging a dataset node down makes the ones below come down
 * too, which creates space for nothing". A card dropped 800 units low left its
 * lane permanently that much taller, so the next dataset sat 800 units lower
 * FOREVER, with dead board between them. Measuring the stack on the arrangement
 * at all is what puts one lane's layout in charge of another lane's position.
 *
 * So: lanes sit where the automatic layout says, and moving a card moves
 * nothing but that card. The cost is stated rather than hidden — a lane
 * arranged taller than its automatic tree can overlap the lane below. That is
 * the same bargain pinned pictures already make, and ✦ Tidy up (which clears
 * the arrangement) is the way back.
 *
 * The moved card still has to be REACHED — ✦ Fit and 📷 Export must frame it —
 * so the live graph's height feeds `maxY` instead, where it grows the board's
 * box without ever advancing the stack. Omit `stackPlaced` and this behaves
 * exactly as it always did: the live graph is used for both.
