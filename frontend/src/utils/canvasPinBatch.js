/* Pin ALL the images a run just produced onto the ◉ LoRA Canvas, in one go.

   A finished generation says "5 images ready" and names the checkpoints they
   joined. Getting them onto the board meant opening each of those galleries and
   pinning the pictures one by one — for a lot spanning four runs, four panels
   and five gestures to see the thing the run was fired to let you see.

   This module is the whole decision layer of the one-click version. Pure, no
   JSX and no DOM, because `node --test` cannot parse JSX and the part that
   decides whether the feature is usable is geometry, not markup.

   ⚠ EVERYTHING HERE IS IN BOARD UNITS, never in screen pixels. The board is
   zoomable (a real board is often read at 24 %); a rule written in pixels would
   be right at one zoom level and wrong at every other one.

   ── The placement, and why this one ──────────────────────────────────────────

   The requirement is not "tidy", it is "nothing may ever be on top of anything
   else" — a lot dropped onto a board that already carries cards, checkpoint
   pills and hand-placed pictures. Three candidates were on the table: a spiral
   around each source, a free-space search from the source's own spot, and a
   band under the tree. The first two share one flaw: they place INTO the tree,
   so they can only work by searching around obstacles, and the result reads as
   scatter — you cannot tell at a glance which picture came from which run, which
   is the only reason to put them on the board at all.

   So: a CONTACT-SHEET BAND below the lane, one COLUMN per source checkpoint,
   each column starting at the x of its own source and sliding right until it
   finds a free column.

     • no overlap is structural, not searched for: the band starts below the
       lowest thing already on the lane, and inside the band each column is
       reserved before it is filled. There is no case where a tile is placed
       "hopefully";
     • a source's images are a vertical stack under that source, so a lot from
       four runs reads as four groups without a legend — and the connector each
       node already draws to its own pill (utils/canvasImageNodes.imageNodeEdges)
       confirms it;
     • it is trivially deterministic — no search order to depend on.

   The cost, stated: a picture is BELOW the tree rather than beside its card, so
   on a deep lineage it is further from its pill than a single hand-pin would
   be. That is the trade the requirement asks for; a pin dropped by hand still
   lands beside its card (defaultImageSpot), which is unchanged.

   ── When there is no room ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Structurally, there always is: the band grows down and right, outside
   everything, and the lane grows with it (imageNodeExtent). So the only bound
   is a deliberate one — PIN_BATCH_MAX — and it is REPORTED, never silent. A lot
   over the cap places the cap and says how many it left out and where to get
   them. Nothing is ever stacked quietly. */
