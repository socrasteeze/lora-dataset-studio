/* ⬇ Taking pictures OFF the board — the decidable half.
 *
 * The ◉ Canvas is the only screen that knows an image's whole ancestry
 * (dataset → run → checkpoint → seed) and, until now, the only way to keep one
 * was a right-click "Save image as…" that threw all of it away. Two things ship:
 * a single image, from the pinned node and from the viewer; and a whole
 * gallery — a run's, or one checkpoint's — as a ZIP.
 *
 * THE NAME IS THE FEATURE and it is NOT computed here. There is no settings
 * sidecar (deliberately), so the file name is the sole carrier of the lineage,
 * and a scheme implemented twice is a scheme that will disagree with itself:
 * it lives once, in `services/gallery_download.py`, where pytest can reach
 * every hostile dataset name. The browser reads the finished name off
 * Content-Disposition or simply lets the download go.
 *
 * What lives HERE is the other half, and it is the half a JSX file would hide:
 * WHICH images a click is about, and whether the screen states the cut BEFORE
 * the archive lands. A ZIP that quietly holds 500 of 812 is exactly the kind of
 * half-truth the rest of this app refuses, so the count is on the button.
 *
 * JSX-free on purpose — `node --test` cannot parse JSX.
