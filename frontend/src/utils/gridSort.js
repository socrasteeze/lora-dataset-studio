/**
 * Grid ORDERING — the companion of `gridStatusFilter.js` / `tagFilter.js`, which
 * only ever narrow a list. Asked for by nofaceman (Discord): both the bank and a
 * dataset already MEASURE things (aesthetic rating, sharpness, face similarity)
 * and let you filter on them, but nothing could put the best — or the worst —
 * in front of your eyes first, which is what makes a review fast.
 *
 * The bank menu now covers EVERY quantity its passes persist, both ways (asked
 * again on Discord after the first three shipped). The rationale for going wide
 * is in image_bank_service._SORT_KEYS: a chip ranks only the rows that cross its
 * threshold, so it can never answer "the noisiest of the ones I am keeping" nor
 * anything asked the other way round.
 *
 * Two surfaces, two mechanics, ONE contract:
 *  • Bank — the grid is paginated over thousands of rows, so the order is a SQL
 *    `sort=` parameter (see image_bank_service._sort_order). This file only owns
 *    the MENU: which entries exist and which ones are honestly usable right now.
 *  • Dataset — the workspace already holds every image of the dataset in memory
 *    (dataset_payload ships them all, and both existing grid filters are
 *    client-side), so sorting here is a pure array transform. Sending it to SQL
 *    would mean a refetch per click for no gain and a second, divergent order.
 *
 * The contract both share:
 *  • A value the matching pass never produced (NULL / undefined) SINKS TO THE END
 *    in BOTH directions. "Worst first" must open on the worst MEASURED image, not
 *    on the pile nobody measured — that is the same decision the resolution sort
 *    already took ("Unscanned images sink to the end").
 *  • An entry whose data does not exist yet is OFFERED BUT DISABLED, with the
 *    reason in its own label — same precedent as the 👥 Group by person button
 *    ("Install the Quality tools (Setup) to sort by person"). A sort that
 *    silently reorders nothing reads as a broken app.
 *  • Sorting NEVER changes membership: it composes with every filter, and the
 *    filtered list keeps exactly the same images.
 *
 * `id`s are stored (bank query string, dataset localStorage) — never rename one
 * without an alias, per the repo rule on stored identifiers.
 */
