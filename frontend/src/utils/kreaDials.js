/* Krea 2 Edit's FOUR calibration dials — `grounding_px`, `steps`, `ref_boost`
   and `identity_lora_strength` — each editable from BOTH surfaces that talk
   about them. PURE JS (no JSX) so `node --test` can exercise it, the same split
   as kreaEngine.js.

   WHY TWO OF THEM WERE UNREACHABLE
   --------------------------------
   `ref_boost` and `identity_lora_strength` are real config keys the graph reads
   on every Krea run (krea_edit_helper._ref_boost / _identity_strength), both
   clamped server-side, and NEITHER had an input anywhere in the app. So the only
   way to move them was to hand-edit config.json — which meant that when likeness
   came out too weak, the one lever that fixes it was the one nobody could touch.
   `grounding_px` and `ref_boost` used to ship as a matched pair (v1 = 1024/4.0,
   v2 = 512/1.0); raise the first alone and you land on a combination no shipped
   profile ever calibrated, with no way to bring the second along.

   WHY ALL FOUR NOW LIVE ON BOTH SCREENS
   -------------------------------------
   They used to be split three ways — grounding editable in Settings and a
   read-out in the panel, two dials editable only in the panel, steps only in
   Settings — so "where do I change this?" had a different answer per dial. The
   rule that replaces that: there is exactly ONE value per key, the global
   setting; every control writes THAT key through the same endpoint. Duplicating
   the control therefore cannot create a second truth — there is nothing to keep
   in sync, only two doors onto the same value. The two PATH fields
   (`base_model`, `identity_lora`) stay in Settings alone on purpose: they are
   filled once at install, not adjusted while judging an image.

   The SERVER stays the authority: it re-clamps every value it is sent. The
   bounds here only stop the UI from offering a number that would be silently
   corrected. */
