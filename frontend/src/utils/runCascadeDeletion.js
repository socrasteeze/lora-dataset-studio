 * COUNT what is about to disappear ("14 checkpoints · 22.4 GB, 37 images") and
 * name what survives, loudly enough that a user can back out by reading.
 *
 * Every decision worth getting wrong is here rather than in the panel, because
 * `node --test` does not parse JSX and these are exactly the sentences that must
 * not be eyeballed: what is deletable at all, what the dialog promises, and how
 * a PARTIAL result is reported (a half-done destruction shown as a success is
 * the worst outcome this feature can have).
