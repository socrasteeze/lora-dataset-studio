/* WHO wrote THIS caption — the per-image reading of `caption_origin`.

   PURE JS (no JSX, no imports) so `node --test` drives it directly.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   captionEngines.js reports the PASS that just ran ("12 by JoyCaption, 3 by the
   Ollama vision model") and its own header names the gap it left open, in as many
   words: "It reports the pass that just ran, not the provenance of a caption you
   are looking at weeks later." The column it asked for exists now — `caption_origin`
   on both image tables, written by every caption writer through
   services/caption_origin.stamp — and it was being used for exactly one decision
   (which rows a forced re-caption spares) while the screen where you READ the
   sentence still showed an anonymous string.

   That gap is not cosmetic. The default backend is 'auto', which is a CHAIN:
   JoyCaption writes what it can, the Ollama vision model covers the rest. The two
   halves land in the same column, in the same font, and until this module nothing
   on screen told them apart — so a caption that describes something the image does
   not contain looked exactly like one that reads it correctly.

   THE FOUR STATES, and the fourth is why this is a module and not a ternary:

     'asserted'   — a human typed, corrected or imported the text. Never folded
                    into the two engines: it is the one a forced pass SKIPS, and
                    calling it "machine-written" would be wrong about the work the
                    user did.
     'joycaption' — written by JoyCaption (local, via the ai-toolkit venv).
     'ollama'     — written by the Ollama vision model.
     NULL / ''    — the author was NEVER RECORDED. This is what every row that
                    predates the column carries, and it is NOT "machine": reading
                    the absence as an engine would put an attribution on screen
                    that nothing measured. It gets its own wording, and callers
                    that would rather stay silent on it can (`known` is false).

   An origin this build does not know is shown UNDER ITS OWN NAME rather than
   dropped — the same rule captionEngines.js follows for an unknown writer, and for
   the same reason: swallowing it rebuilds the blind spot the module exists to close.

   header). Read them; never rename them here. */
