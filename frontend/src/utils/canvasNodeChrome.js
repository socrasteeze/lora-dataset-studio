/* The CHROME of a pinned image on the ◉ LoRA Canvas — its ✕, its and its
   resize corner — and why those three need arithmetic of their own.

   Everything else on this board is measured in BOARD units, and that is right:
   a card, a pill and a picture all live in one zoomable coordinate system, so
   they keep their relationships at every scale. Controls are the exception, and
   the bug report is the proof. The ✕ of a pinned image "did not work" on a
   phone. The handler was fine — the board has refused to start a drag from a
   node's own button for as long as the feature has existed. What was not fine
   was the TARGET: the header button is ~16 board units, the board is routinely
   read at 24-65 %, and 16 × 0.65 ≈ 10 screen pixels — a quarter of the ~40 px a
   finger actually lands on. The button was not broken, it was unhittable, and
   the 🔍 sitting right beside it meant a near miss opened the full-screen view
   instead of closing the node. That reads exactly like "the cross does nothing".

   So a control is sized in SCREEN space: it is counter-scaled by the board's own
   zoom, which keeps it the same size under the finger whatever the board is
   doing. Two bounds keep that honest:

     • never SMALLER than its board size (zooming in must not shrink the chrome
       into a speck sitting on a huge picture);
     • never so large that it eats the picture it decorates — at 10 % zoom a
       constant-size button would be wider than the thumbnail it sits on, so the
       counter-scale is capped as a fraction of the node's own width.

   JSX-free, because `node --test` cannot parse JSX and this is the part worth
   testing: the component only applies the number. */
