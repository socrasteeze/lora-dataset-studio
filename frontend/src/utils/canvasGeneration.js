/* Picking checkpoints ON THE BOARD, and deciding what a launch from there means.

   The LoRA Canvas mounts the very same Test-Studio engine as the Test Studio
   page — the same hooks, the same settings panel, the same POST. Exactly one
   thing differs: the checkpoints are not chosen in a picker, they are chosen by
   clicking the pills under the run cards, possibly across several datasets.

   Everything that follows from THAT lives here, JSX-free so `node --test` can
   exercise it without a browser:

     · the selection itself (a list, order = the order they were clicked);
     · whether a launch is possible, and if not, in the user's words WHY;
     · the request body the shared engine expects.

   Two refusals matter and they are not the same kind of thing:

     mixed FAMILIES — an impossibility. Krea and Z-Image do not share a base
       model or a workflow; one run cannot render both. The button goes dead and
       says which two families are in the way.
     not DEPLOYED — merely something to do first. The button offers to do it:
       "Deploy 2 checkpoints, then generate". Nothing is written to the user's
       ComfyUI folder until they click a button that said it would. */
