/* Picking checkpoints ON THE BOARD, and deciding what a launch from there means.

   The LoRA Canvas mounts the very same Test-Studio engine as the Test Studio
   page — the same hooks, the same settings panel, the same POST. Exactly one
   thing differs: the checkpoints are not chosen in a picker, they are chosen by
   clicking the pills under the run cards, possibly across several datasets.

   Everything that follows from THAT lives here, JSX-free so `node --test` can
   exercise it without a browser:

     · the selection itself (a list, order = the order they were clicked);
     · whether a launch is possible, and if not, in the user's words WHY;
     · the request body the shared engine expects.

   Two refusals matter and they are not the same kind of thing:

     mixed FAMILIES — an impossibility. Krea and Z-Image do not share a base
       model or a workflow; one run cannot render both. The button goes dead and
       says which two families are in the way.
     not DEPLOYED — merely something to do first. The button offers to do it:
       "Deploy 2 checkpoints, then generate". Nothing is written to the user's
       ComfyUI folder until they click a button that said it would. */

/* 🧬 BLEND — the board's side of the Test Studio's Blend mode.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Compare (the default, and everything above) runs one pass PER ticked
   checkpoint. Blend loads them ALL into a single generation, each at its own
   weight, with every dataset's trigger word injected into the prompt.

   None of that logic is re-written here. The weights, their 0..2 clamp and the
   "at least two LoRAs, all of one family" rule are the Test Studio's, imported
   from studio/loraStack.js — one implementation, so the two screens cannot
   disagree about what a blend is. What this section adds is the shim between
   the board's camelCase picks and the shape that module reads.

   The shim is built so that `stackKey` of a shimmed pick IS
   `canvasCheckpointKey` of that pick: a weight is keyed on the PILL, never on
   the deployed filename. That filename is null while a checkpoint is on disk
   only, and it APPEARS when "Deploy, then generate" runs — keying on it would
   have silently reset every slider the user moved before launching. */
