/* Why a LOCAL engine (Klein, Krea 2 Edit) can't run on THIS install — one
   answer, shared by every surface that offers those engines.
   PURE JS (no JSX) so `node --test` can exercise it directly.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   The generation panel had computed Klein's reason inline for a long time, and
   Krea's in utils/kreaEngine.js — two half-answers to one question, in two
   files. An inline copy per surface is how "⚠ Configure ComfyUI in Settings"
   ends up worded one way in one dialog and another way two clicks later, for
   the same missing file. So the reason moved HERE and every caller reads it.

   Every branch answers one question: what is the ONE thing to do next? "Not
   available" is an inert button; the user cannot tell a missing weight from a
   stopped ComfyUI from a node pack that needs a restart. */

import { comfyEnumUnavailableReason } from './comfyEnumSupport.js';
// The REQUIRED-weights vocabulary already exists, next to the Setup step that
// downloads them. Re-listing it here is how the picker and Setup end up naming
// different files for one gap; the recommended LoRA stays excluded there for the
// right reason (optional + auto-fetched, so naming it sends the user nowhere).
import { kleinMissingLabels } from '../hooks/useSetupSteps.js';

/** Why Klein can't be picked, or null when it can. Ordered by what has to be
 *  fixed FIRST — a disabled engine and an unreachable ComfyUI both make the asset
 *  list meaningless.
 *
 *  The enum gap comes BEFORE the weights: a reachable ComfyUI with every file in
 *  place can still refuse a widget VALUE the graph pins (the `beta57` scheduler
 *  took Klein out for everyone without the RES4LYF pack while every other check
 *  went green). Naming the weights there sends the user to re-check a step that
 *  was already correct. */
