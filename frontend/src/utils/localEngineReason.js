/* Why a LOCAL engine (Klein, Krea 2 Edit) can't run on THIS install — one
   answer, shared by every surface that offers those engines.
   PURE JS (no JSX) so `node --test` can exercise it directly.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   The generation panel had computed Klein's reason inline for a long time, and
   Krea's in utils/kreaEngine.js — two half-answers to one question, in two
   files. An inline copy per surface is how "⚠ Configure ComfyUI in Settings"
   ends up worded one way in one dialog and another way two clicks later, for
   the same missing file. So the reason moved HERE and every caller reads it.

   Every branch answers one question: what is the ONE thing to do next? "Not
   available" is an inert button; the user cannot tell a missing weight from a
   stopped ComfyUI from a node pack that needs a restart. */
import { kreaUnavailableReason } from './kreaEngine.js';
import { comfyEnumUnavailableReason } from './comfyEnumSupport.js';
// The REQUIRED-weights vocabulary already exists, next to the Setup step that
// downloads them. Re-listing it here is how the picker and Setup end up naming
// different files for one gap; the recommended LoRA stays excluded there for the
// right reason (optional + auto-fetched, so naming it sends the user nowhere).

/** Why Klein can't be picked, or null when it can. Ordered by what has to be
 *  fixed FIRST — a disabled engine and an unreachable ComfyUI both make the asset
 *  list meaningless.
 *
 *  The enum gap comes BEFORE the weights: a reachable ComfyUI with every file in
 *  place can still refuse a widget VALUE the graph pins (the `beta57` scheduler
 *  took Klein out for everyone without the RES4LYF pack while every other check
 *  went green). Naming the weights there sends the user to re-check a step that
 *  was already correct.
 *
 *  `invalidAssets` is the branch this function was MISSING, and its absence is
 *  what reported a 9.5 GB file on disk as "Klein model missing" (zigzag4794,
 *  Discord): a truncated download is present, so no weight is named, and the
 *  sentence fell through to the catch-all. Krea has had this branch since its
 *  own licence-gate incident — Klein now says the same thing, from the same
 *  helper. */

/** THE readiness verdict for a local engine — one question, one answer, for every
 *  screen that asks it.
 *
 *  WHY THIS EXISTS (and why Setup must not compute its own)
 *  --------------------------------------------------------
 *  `engines.klein` / `engines.krea` are computed by the BACKEND, from five
 *  conditions for Klein (ComfyUI reachable, no unsupported widget value, the UNET
 *  + text encoder + VAE all resolvable, no blocking-invalid required weight) and
 *  four for Krea. The Setup wizard used to re-derive its own version of that from
 *  the raw ingredients, and the install menu judged each file on presence alone —
 *  so a truncated 9.5 GB UNET read "✓ Installed" on one screen while the
 *  generation page refused the engine on the next. Two screens, both sincere,
 *  contradicting each other, with the user sent to fix the one thing that was
 *  fine.
 *
 *  So: the backend verdict is the truth, this reads it, and everything else reads
 *  this. Nothing here recomputes readiness — `reason` only EXPLAINS a verdict it
 *  was given.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *    ready    — the engine can be used right now (the backend said so);
 *    verified — whether the checks that need a live ComfyUI could actually RUN.
 *               False means "not checked", which is not the same as "checked and
 *               fine" and must never render as a ✓. The unsupported-value probe
 *               fails OPEN by design (an unreachable ComfyUI reports no gap rather
 *               than inventing one); this flag is how a screen says so out loud
 *               instead of inheriting a silent all-clear.
 *    reason   — null when ready, else the ONE shared sentence naming the real gap. */
