/* ▶ Continue — which lanes the RUNS HUB can offer for one finished run.

   JSX-free so `node --test` exercises the real rule (CloudRunsPage.jsx imports
   this exact function), like lineageContinue.js does for the graph's gate.

   A checkpoint is just a file: a cloud run's epoch is mirrored into this
   machine's ai-toolkit run dir, so it can be finished HERE instead of on another
   rented pod. Both lanes are always returned — an unusable one carries its
   reason and the dialog shows it disabled, never hidden.

   The two guards are deliberately NOT symmetrical, and that is the whole
   difference with the dataset panel:
     - local training is single-flight for the WHOLE machine, so `localActive`
       closes the lane whatever dataset that run belongs to;
     - the cloud guard is per (dataset, family), and this hub lists runs of MANY
       datasets — it must be evaluated against the TARGET run's dataset, never
       page-wide. */
