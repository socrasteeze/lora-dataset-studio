/* Which engine runs the ✨ Upscale & improve pass, and how the UI says what the
   difference IS.

   The whole point of issue #32 (SurpassHR) is that the two passes are not two
   qualities of the same thing: Klein REWRITES (a diffusion edit that re-renders
   skin and micro-detail — it fixes a soft photo and it changes it), SeedVR2
   RESTORES (one-step super-resolution that leaves the content alone). Someone
   picking blind will pick wrong on a dataset built around an exact look, so the
   one-line positioning lives here, next to the ids, rather than being retyped in
   each surface where it could drift apart.

   Pure module, no JSX — the contract tests run under `node --test`. */

/** The per-image ✨ buttons for ONE image in the lightbox: one entry per engine

    The lightbox is an EXPLICIT per-image choice, so both engines are offered
    side by side and neither is decided by the `improve.engine` setting — that
    setting only governs surfaces with a single ✨ button. This is the same rule
    the bulk toolbar follows, expressed once.

    `{id, label, title, disabled, showKleinNote}` per engine:
      * `label` reflects the IMAGE's state (a candidate already waiting for
        review, one still rendering) before the engine's own name, because that
        state blocks every engine equally and is what the user needs to read.
      * `showKleinNote` is true for Klein alone. The amber anime/drawn warning is
        about Klein's INSTRUCTION ("detailed texture, sharp details") pulling
        drawn skin towards realism — SeedVR2 sends no instruction at all, so
        repeating the warning under it would be false and would push people away
        from the very pass that fixes their case.
