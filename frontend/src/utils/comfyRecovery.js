/* What the app-wide ComfyUI recovery banner says.
 *
 * The bug this exists for: the recovery barrier is GLOBAL — one stalled prompt
 * blocks every local generation in the app — but its only resolution used to be
 * the Stop button of the dataset that happened to own the job. Working on any
 * other dataset meant an endless "a previous ComfyUI job has an unresolved
 * remote state", with the fix invisible from where you were standing.
 *
 * So the banner's job is to answer, from anywhere: what is stuck, where it
 * lives, since when, and what one click will do about it. Pure functions here,
 * pixels in ComfyRecoveryBanner.jsx.
