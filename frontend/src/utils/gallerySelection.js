/* 🖼 The checkpoint gallery's selection + delete wording — the DECIDABLE part,
 * kept free of JSX so `node --test` can run it.
 *
 * A checkpoint can hold thirty-odd renders and most of them are misses, so the
 * gallery deletes in BATCHES: pick, then one confirmation for the lot. Two
 * things about that are easy to get wrong and impossible to see in a screenshot,
 * hence this module:
 *
 *  1. selection must survive a refresh that no longer lists an image (something
 *     else deleted it, the limit moved) — a stale id in the set would arm a
 *     delete for something the user cannot see;
 *  2. the confirmation must state BOTH consequences before the button arms: the
 *     images also leave the Test Studio (one row, two surfaces), and WHERE the
 *     files go. Missing evidence downgrades the promise, it never hides it.
