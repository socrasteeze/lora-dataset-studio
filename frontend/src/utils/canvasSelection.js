/* Which datasets the ◉ LoRA Canvas is showing — a display preference, not data.

   JSX-free so `node --test` runs it. The rules are small but every one of them
   was a bug waiting to happen:

   • Nothing stored yet = show EVERYTHING. The canvas' promise is "all your
     datasets on one surface"; opening on an empty board and asking the user to
     go find the filter would be the opposite.
   • A stored id whose dataset is gone is dropped silently, never drawn as an
     empty lane and never resurrected if an id is reused.
   • Deselecting every dataset is a legitimate choice and survives a reload — it
     must not be "helpfully" reset to all, or the filter would fight the user.

   ⚠ The stored ids are DATABASE dataset ids: stable, never renamed. Nothing in
   here may start persisting names instead — those DO change, and a rename would
   silently empty someone's board. */

// stray string) is not an id — Number() would turn several of them into 0 and
// quietly add a lane for "dataset 0".
