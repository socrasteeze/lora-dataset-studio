/* What a surface says and does when the local Ollama fence refuses it.
 *
 * The fence itself is right: LDS must not unload a model another tool loaded,
 * because on a machine that also runs an image generator, that model is
 * somebody's real work. What was wrong is that the refusal ENDED there. It
 * named the remedy in prose ("unload it first"), then left the user to go find
 * an Ollama prompt, do it by hand, come back, and click the button again.
 *
 * Two things change that, and both live here:
 *
 *   1. Consent, not silence. The user can say "unload it and continue" in one
 *      click. That click is the whole difference — the default stays refuse.
 *   2. Patience. Ollama unloads an idle model by itself after a few minutes,
 *      so most of these blocks end on their own. Instead of failing, the
 *      surface waits, watches, and resumes the action it was asked to do. The
 *      commonest case then costs zero clicks.
 *
 * Pure functions here (a `node --test` file imports them directly); React in
 * useOllamaFence.js and OllamaFenceNotice.jsx.
