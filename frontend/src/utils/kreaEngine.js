/* Krea 2 Identity Edit — the pure, testable half of the engine's UI.
   PURE JS (no JSX) so `node --test` can import and exercise it directly, the
   same split as engineSelection.js.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   "Other people don't have my install." Krea needs FOUR weight files AND a
   community custom-node pack, and each of those can be missing for a different
   reason with a different fix. A card that just greys out with "not available"
   is an inert button; the user has no idea whether to install a node pack, drop
   a LoRA somewhere, or fix their ComfyUI URL. So the reason is computed here,
   from the capabilities payload, and it is unit-tested — one branch per real
   failure mode, in the order the user must fix them. */

/* ── Reference shape vs framing (MEASURED, 2026-07-25) ──────────────────────
   Krea reproduces the REFERENCE's aspect ratio, capped at 2 MP
   (krea_edit_helper.fit_output_size): the edit LoRA was trained on same-size
   pairs, so the shot's own `aspect` hint is deliberately ignored — for this
   engine ONLY. Klein and the API engines still honour the shot.

   Consequence, same shot / same seed / same graph:
     square 1024x1024 reference  -> `body_stand_front` came back a BUST
     portrait 835x1024 reference -> full figure down to the calves
   Nothing is broken and no prompt fixes it: a standing figure does not fit in a
   square, so the model resolves the conflict by moving in. The human catalog is
   17 `body` + 1 `back` shots (plus the 🔞 ones), so a square reference quietly
   squeezes almost every wide shot a character dataset needs.

   Hence: say it when the user picks the engine or the shots, not after twenty
   generations — and offer the gesture (crop the reference to a portrait ratio)
   rather than the observation. */
