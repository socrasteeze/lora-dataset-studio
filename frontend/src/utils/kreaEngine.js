/* Krea 2 Identity Edit — the pure, testable half of the engine's UI.
   PURE JS (no JSX) so `node --test` can import and exercise it directly, the
   same split as engineSelection.js.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   "Other people don't have my install." Krea needs FOUR weight files AND a
   community custom-node pack, and each of those can be missing for a different
   reason with a different fix. A card that just greys out with "not available"
   is an inert button; the user has no idea whether to install a node pack, drop
   a LoRA somewhere, or fix their ComfyUI URL. So the reason is computed here,
   from the capabilities payload, and it is unit-tested — one branch per real
   failure mode, in the order the user must fix them. */

  // now ACTS instead of explaining. The invariant is not "say Setup" or "say

  // Krea. Re-check that before rewording it again.

  // "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" at generate time.
  // Worded by the SHARED helper: Klein hit the same class of failure (a truncated
