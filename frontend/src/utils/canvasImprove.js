/* ✨ Upscale & improve, offered on a picture of the ◉ Canvas board.

   WHY THIS IS NOT THE DATASET IMPROVE, even though it is the same button.
   The board's pictures are `lora_test_image` rows (that is what
   `canvas_image_node.image_id` stores); the dataset lightbox's pictures are
   `face_dataset_image` rows. Two tables, two INDEPENDENT id spaces. Sending a
   board id to `/api/dataset/image/<id>/improve` does not fail — it finds a real,
   unrelated dataset image and improves THAT one. So the surfaces share the
   engine choice, the wording and the Klein note (all of them reused from
   utils/improveEngines.js and components/dataset/KleinImproveNote.jsx), and
   nothing else. The route is its own.

   Pure module, no JSX — `node --test` cannot parse JSX and this is the part with
   the cases worth pinning. */

/** The stored derivation kind of a canvas improvement, mirroring the backend
    (`lora_test_studio.CANVAS_IMAGE_IMPROVE`). ⚠️ It is written into user
    databases: renaming it would strand every row already there, so it never
    changes without an alias path. */

 *
 * Worded as the backend refuses (lora_test_studio.IMPROVE_*), so the surface
 * explains itself BEFORE the click instead of surfacing an error after it.
 * Returning a REASON rather than a boolean is what lets the caller choose
 * between hiding the action and showing it disabled with the reason attached.

    nothing on the board changes. A toast that only said "started" would read as
