/* Images pinned onto the ◉ LoRA Canvas — the geometry layer.

   The board exists to compare checkpoints, and what is actually being compared
   is the picture. A picture you can only see one at a time, in a modal, is a
   picture you cannot compare — so a generated image can be dropped ONTO the
   board as a node of its own, next to the pill that made it, moved and resized
   like everything else there.

   Same shape as utils/canvasPlacement.js and for the same reason: pure
   functions, no JSX and no DOM, so the parts that decide whether the feature
   ages well — what happens to a pin whose image was deleted, what a lane's
   extent becomes, where a brand-new pin lands — are exercised by `node --test`
   instead of by dragging things in a browser.

   Coordinates are LANE-LOCAL world units, exactly like a card position, so both
   kinds of node live in one coordinate system and one lane extent.

   ⚠ THE promise of this module: closing a pinned image must not forget it.
   `visible: false` is a state, not a deletion — the row keeps its x/y/w/h and
   re-opening reads them back (`openGeometry`). A close that dropped the
   geometry would make "put it back where it was" impossible to implement
   anywhere else. */
