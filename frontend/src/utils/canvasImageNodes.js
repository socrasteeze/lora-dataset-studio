/* Images pinned onto the ◉ LoRA Canvas — the geometry layer.

   The board exists to compare checkpoints, and what is actually being compared
   is the picture. A picture you can only see one at a time, in a modal, is a
   picture you cannot compare — so a generated image can be dropped ONTO the
   board as a node of its own, next to the pill that made it, moved and resized
   like everything else there.

   Same shape as utils/canvasPlacement.js and for the same reason: pure
   functions, no JSX and no DOM, so the parts that decide whether the feature
   ages well — what happens to a pin whose image was deleted, what a lane's
   extent becomes, where a brand-new pin lands — are exercised by `node --test`
   instead of by dragging things in a browser.

   Coordinates are LANE-LOCAL world units, exactly like a card position, so both
   kinds of node live in one coordinate system.

   ⚠️ LANE-LOCAL IS THE ANCHOR, NOT A CAGE. A picture may sit anywhere on the
   board, including ABOVE and LEFT of its own lane's origin — that is what the
   negative half of the reach below is for. What stays lane-local is the
   REFERENCE the number is measured from, and that is deliberate: a lane's world
   position is derived from the board's current filter (which datasets are
   ticked) and from the height of every lane above it, so it moves by hundreds
   of units the moment an unrelated dataset is unticked or gains a run —
   measured on a three-dataset board, 580 units for one untick, 118 for one new
   run. A picture stored in BOARD-absolute units would sit still while its lane
   slid out from under it, and the day a dataset above is filtered off, every
   picture below would be hovering over the wrong lane. Measured from its own
   lane, it travels with the run it is evidence about, which is the only
   relationship on this board that never goes stale.

   ⚠ THE promise of this module: closing a pinned image must not forget it.
   `visible: false` is a state, not a deletion — the row keeps its x/y/w/h and
   re-opening reads them back (`openGeometry`). A close that dropped the
   geometry would make "put it back where it was" impossible to implement
   anywhere else. */
