/* Wording and arithmetic for the concept face-mask preview's progress.

   PURE (no React, no fetch) so the honest-message logic is testable on its own —
   node --test cannot parse JSX, so anything worth asserting lives here.

   The point of naming phases: the per-image counter alone LIES about the wait.
   InsightFace imports onnxruntime and prepares antelopev2 before image 1, which
   is tens of seconds, and on a fresh install it first downloads ~350 MB. A bar
   sitting at 0/40 through all of that is read as "it crashed" at exactly the
   moment nothing at all was wrong. So each stage says what it is, and only the
   stages that really cost are named. */
