/* 🔌 Is this checkpoint DEPLOYED — i.e. can I generate from it right now?

   The pills under a run card (250, 500, … 3500) already knew the answer and
   never said it: `testable` rides on every pill and only surfaced as the words
   "· to deploy" inside the generation panel — AFTER the checkpoints were picked.
   The question is asked before picking, so the answer has to be on the pill.

   ⚠ Two orthogonal dimensions live on that same 60×20 rectangle and both have
   to stay readable at once:

     • DEPLOYED / NOT DEPLOYED — a system fact, persistent. New here.
     • PICKED / NOT PICKED — the user's transient choice, already drawn as an
       indigo corner checkbox plus an indigo ring.

   Plus two meanings the shell already carries: EMERALD = this is the run's final
   checkpoint, DASHED = the file is gone from the disk. So deployment gets a
   channel of its own that touches none of them: a dedicated corner badge on the
   opposite corner from the checkbox, ROUND where the checkbox is square, in a
   colour used nowhere else on a pill.

   And never colour alone — roughly one man in twelve reads red and green the
   same, and the theme is dark graphite. Each state therefore carries THREE
   signals: a colour, a shape (filled disc vs hollow ring), and words in the
   pill's own title/aria text.

   Vocabulary, and it matters: NOT deployed does not mean missing. The file is on
   the disk (the card says "14 on disk"); it is simply not copied into ComfyUI
   yet, so nothing can generate from it until it is — which the board's own
   Generate button offers to do. Nothing here may read as "lost". */

/* How the state is DRAWN on a pill: a bar down its left edge.
   The edge, not a corner dot, because the corners are taken (the pick checkbox
   hangs off the top-left) and because a full-height bar stays visible when the
   board is zoomed out to fit a dozen lanes, where a 6-px dot is gone.
   Solid vs DASHED is the shape channel — it survives a greyscale screenshot and
   colour-blind vision alike; sky vs slate is the colour channel, and neither is
   a colour the pill already uses (emerald = final save, indigo = picked or
   resumed-from, amber = warning). */
