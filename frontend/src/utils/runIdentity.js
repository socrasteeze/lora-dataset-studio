/* ── ONE number for a run, across every lineage surface ──────────────────────
   A run has two identifiers: its provenance RECORD id (the stable key — every
   run has one, local or cloud) and, for a rented-GPU run, the CLOUD run id. The
   lineage surfaces disagreed: the graph card and the tree printed the cloud id
   ("#103") while the inspector printed the record id ("Run #107"), so clicking a
   card opened a panel bearing a different number with nothing tying them.

   The record id wins as THE run number: a local run has no cloud id at all, so
   the cloud id cannot BE a run's identity. The cloud id is not hidden — it is
   shown as an explicit secondary ("Run #107 · cloud #103"), never as a bare
   number that reads like the run's own.

   Display only: no stored key changes. What was keyed by record id (checkpoint
   selections, notes) or by cloud run id (Runs deep links, checkpoint replays)
   still addresses exactly what it did before. */
