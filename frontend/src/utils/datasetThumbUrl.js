/* TILE-SIZED PICTURES — one rewrite instead of twenty hand-written URLs.
 *
 * `/api/dataset/<id>/img/<name>` serves the ORIGINAL bytes: a 1-4 megapixel PNG,
 * often several megabytes, fully decoded by the browser so it can paint a 96 px
 * tile. The board, the dataset grid, the Test Studio sweep, the checkpoint
 * preview pills and the cloud-run cards all did exactly that, on every open.
 * `/api/dataset/<id>/thumb/<name>?s=<side>` is the same picture as a cached WebP.
 *
 * This is a URL REWRITE and not "build the thumb URL from an id and a filename"
 * on purpose: several of these URLs are stamped by the BACKEND (a canvas image
 * node's `url`, a checkpoint pill's `preview.url`, a run card's `preview_url`)
 * and the components that draw them never see the pieces. Rewriting means one
 * function is the only thing that knows the endpoint's shape.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO TOUCH is the load-bearing half: anything that is not a
 * dataset `/img/` URL comes back verbatim. A bank URL, a blob:, a data:, a
 * missing value — a tile that silently 404s because a helper rewrote a URL it
 * did not understand is a worse bug than a heavy tile.
