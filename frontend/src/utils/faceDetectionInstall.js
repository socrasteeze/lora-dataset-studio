// Face detection (InsightFace) as an OPTIONAL, contextually-offered extra.
// PURE JS (JSX-free) so node --test can import it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// The capability is filed under the key `face_scoring` everywhere — the probe
// (capabilities.probe_face_scoring), the installer action, the config overrides
// (`face_scoring.python`, `face_scoring.models_root`). That key is STORED (config
// JSON on every install out there), so it is never renamed. What was wrong is
// what the user SEES: somebody ticking "Mask faces" has no reason to go hunting
// for a "face-similarity scoring" extra. So the key stays, the wording changes,
// and this module is the single place that maps one to the other.
//
// It is also deliberately a PROMPT, not a requirement. InsightFace is a few
// hundred megabytes; nothing here installs on its own, at startup or "on first
// need". The app stays fully usable without it — the option is simply disabled
// AND explained, and never nags.

/** The installer action. STORED KEY — never rename without an alias path
 *  (backend `_CAPABILITY_PACKAGES`, `_INSTALL_ALL_ORDER`, config `face_scoring.*`). */

/** Announced BEFORE the click, on purpose: someone who accepts a 400 MB download
 *  knowingly does not feel trapped; someone who discovers it mid-flight does.
 *  Order of magnitude from requirements-ml.txt (insightface + onnxruntime + numpy
