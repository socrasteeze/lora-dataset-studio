// Which live dataset activity blocks which new action.
//
// `dataset_activity` (backend) publishes ONE entry per dataset describing the
// batch currently running on it. The hook used to turn that entry into a single
// boolean — `busyLive = busy || !!activity` — and hand it to every action button
// in the workspace. So starting a ✨ Upscale & improve batch, or merely retrying
// ONE tile (the synchronous regenerate publishes a 'generate' activity of
// total=1), greyed out Generate, the watermark passes, captioning, everything,
// for as long as the batch ran. That is GitHub #44, reported by charlesangus:
// "kicking off any generation task should allow more generation tasks to be
// queued up; the user should not have to wait for one to finish before kicking
// off the next".
//
// The blanket was never load-bearing. `backend/app/job_queue.py` is a FIFO
// worker over `image_generation_queue` and `lora_test_studio.gpu_busy_reason`
// says so in as many words: "the queue itself serializes normal generations, so
// no further locking is needed". Work piled on top does not collide — it lines
// up, which is exactly what was asked for.
//
// So the rule is about WHICH RESOURCE an activity holds, in two lanes:
//
//   * QUEUE — work that becomes rows in the serialized image queue. Several of
//     these may be in flight at once; the worker takes them one at a time.
//   * EXCLUSIVE — a pass that walks the dataset's rows and rewrites them
//     (captioning, watermarks, face analysis, exports, backups), or that holds
//     the GPU vision window and therefore pauses ComfyUI. Two of those overlap
//     badly, and one of those overlapping a generation is what the vision fence
//     exists to prevent.
//
// Only QUEUE-on-QUEUE overlaps. Everything else keeps the behaviour it had.
//
// This is the same shape as `components/dataset/scraperState.js`, whose gates
// already carved out targeted exemptions by kind. `isDatasetImportBlocked` asks
// this very question and now reads `laneOf` rather than naming 'generate' by
// hand, so the lane list lives in ONE place. `isStopGenerationBlocked` stays on
// its own list on purpose: it answers a different question — which activities
// the Stop button EXISTS to end — and 'improve' is stoppable without being
// blocking.

// Activities whose work is a row in the serialized image queue.

// Queue-lane kinds the BACKEND still refuses to run twice on one dataset, so

//                         running on this dataset" (409).

// This fork ships no cloud engine, so every render — Klein, Krea 2 Edit, or a

// ComfyUI and does hold the local GPU. Upstream names its two remote engines
// here; naming them on this fork would be dead plumbing AND the exact D1b trap
// (a membership test that is always false, quietly re-growing the lane on the
// next sync). Never add an id: an engine that renders elsewhere does not exist
// here, and if one ever did, it would arrive with the whole cloud lane.

 * the exclusive GPU vision window, and the import dropzone's auto head-crop is
 * exactly that. Widening the import gate (`isDatasetImportBlocked`) without

/**
 * Is a pass running that owns the dataset's ROWS?
 *
 * The gate for curating an image — keep/reject, caption, crop, mirror, rotate,
 * delete, score, watermark. Not the same question as `activityBlocks`, which
 * answers for a new QUEUED job; curation is not queue work and would be refused
 * by that one for the wrong reason.
 *
 * Queued work does not conflict with curation, and every one of those writes is
 * already defended where it matters — `delete_image` cancels the in-flight job
 * first and refuses outright when it cannot prove the cancellation;
 * `gpu_exclusive_vision_window` is fail-closed and answers "ComfyUI has queued
 * or active work" in words; `crop_image` cannot even touch a row that has no
 * file yet. The UI blanket duplicated those guards, and duplicated them worse:
 * a grey button says nothing, while the refusals underneath are sentences.
 *
 * An EXCLUSIVE pass is the real conflict, and keeps blocking: captioning,
 * watermarks, face analysis, classification, exports and backups all walk the
 * dataset's rows and rewrite them, so a second writer would race them.
