/* ◉ LoRA Canvas — every dataset's training genealogy on one board.

   Until now a lineage graph was locked inside a single run's card: one dataset
   at a time, in a fixed frame. This page promotes it. Same trees, same cards,
   same edges — but all of them on one surface you can zoom and pan, with a
   filter to decide which datasets are on it.

   Loading is deliberately in TWO steps. The index (which datasets have runs) is
   a couple of grouped queries and arrives instantly, so the filter and the frame
   are usable straight away; each dataset's genealogy — which scans that run's
   saves on disk — is then fetched on its own and its lane fills in when it
   lands. One request for the whole library would have meant an empty screen for
   as long as the slowest disk scan took.

   Fetches are capped to a few at a time. A library of thirty trained datasets
   firing thirty concurrent disk-scanning requests would stall the very server
   that also has to answer whatever training or captioning is running. */

       Neither of the obvious answers is right: deleting them would make a
       "rebuild the automatic tree" button destroy content the user placed
       deliberately, and leaving them alone would strand every picture at
       coordinates chosen next to a card that has just moved back. So each
       VISIBLE pin is recomputed to its default spot beside its own card, which
       is the tidy version of exactly what it was.

       CLOSED pins are not touched: their remembered geometry is a promise
       ("re-open it where I closed it") and Tidy up is not the place to break
       it. The re-flow needs the laid-out lane, so it is done here against the
       automatic tree the board is about to fall back to.

       It re-flows through the SAME function 📌 Pin all uses
       (utils/canvasPinBatch), on purpose: two placers would be two chances to
       disagree, and the one thing the user is promised on this board is that
       nothing lands on top of anything. Before this, the re-flow only avoided
