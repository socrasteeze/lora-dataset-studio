/* ◉ LoRA Canvas — every dataset's training genealogy on one board.

   Until now a lineage graph was locked inside a single run's card: one dataset
   at a time, in a fixed frame. This page promotes it. Same trees, same cards,
   same edges — but all of them on one surface you can zoom and pan, with a
   filter to decide which datasets are on it.

   Loading is deliberately in TWO steps. The index (which datasets have runs) is
   a couple of grouped queries and arrives instantly, so the filter and the frame
   are usable straight away; each dataset's genealogy — which scans that run's
   saves on disk — is then fetched on its own and its lane fills in when it
   lands. One request for the whole library would have meant an empty screen for
   as long as the slowest disk scan took.

   Fetches are capped to a few at a time. A library of thirty trained datasets
   firing thirty concurrent disk-scanning requests would stall the very server
   that also has to answer whatever training or captioning is running. */

     the user with a modal about a rectangle.

     A closed node keeps its row and its geometry (`visible: false`), which is
     what makes re-opening it land on the same spot at the same size.

     🖼🖼 `group_id`/`group_pos` travel the same way — which side-by-side strip
     this picture belongs to, and where in it. They are ADDITIVE and nullable:
     an install whose database predates them reads null and draws the board it
     always drew. A row that does not MENTION them keeps whatever it had, so a
     plain move or resize can never quietly dissolve a group.

     ⌨ `opts.coalesce` — the screen half ALWAYS happens immediately; only the
     PUT is deferred, and only when the caller says the write is one of a burst
     it is still in the middle of (a held arrow key repeats ~30×/s, and each
     repeat was a full PUT of the node). The pending rows are merged per
     dataset, so the request that finally goes out describes where the picture

       it. The re-flow needs the laid-out lane, so it is done here against the
       automatic tree the board is about to fall back to.

       It re-flows through the SAME function 📌 Pin all uses

       disagree, and the one thing the user is promised on this board is that
