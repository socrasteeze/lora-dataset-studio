/* ◉ LoRA Canvas — every dataset's training genealogy on one board.

   Until now a lineage graph was locked inside a single run's card: one dataset
   at a time, in a fixed frame. This page promotes it. Same trees, same cards,
   same edges — but all of them on one surface you can zoom and pan, with a
   filter to decide which datasets are on it.

   Loading is deliberately in TWO steps. The index (which datasets have runs) is
   a couple of grouped queries and arrives instantly, so the filter and the frame
   are usable straight away; each dataset's genealogy — which scans that run's
   saves on disk — is then fetched on its own and its lane fills in when it
   lands. One request for the whole library would have meant an empty screen for
   as long as the slowest disk scan took.

   Fetches are capped to a few at a time. A library of thirty trained datasets
   firing thirty concurrent disk-scanning requests would stall the very server
   that also has to answer whatever training or captioning is running. */
