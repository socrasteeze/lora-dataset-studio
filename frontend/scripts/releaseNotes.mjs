// =====================================================================//
//  Release notes generator — turns 🎁 What's new into a release body
// =====================================================================//
//  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//  --------------------
//  Release bodies used to be `--notes "<preamble>" --generate-notes`. gh builds
//  "What's Changed" from MERGED PULL REQUESTS, and this repo has none — every
//  change lands straight on main. So the generated half was always empty and the
//  body was the 747-character preamble and nothing else. Three releases shipped
//  that way in one day before anyone noticed, because nothing checked.
//
//  The product changelog already exists and is written by hand at ship time, in
//  user-facing English, with the contributor credits: frontend/src/whatsNew.js.
//  This module wires it to the release.
//
//  ── WHICH ENTRIES BELONG TO A RELEASE ───────────────────────────────────────
//  By git diff of whatsNew.js between the two tags, NOT by entry `date`.
//  Three releases were cut on 2026-07-27 (v2026.07.28, .1, .2) and every entry
//  they shipped is dated 2026-07-27 — a date filter cannot split them, and would
//  give all three the same body. It also mis-files the routine case of an entry
//  written yesterday and shipped today. The diff answers the only question that
//  matters: what is in THIS tag that was not in the previous one.
//
//  ── HOW THE TWO SIDES ARE READ (deliberately asymmetric) ────────────────────
//  • CURRENT tag: the file is IMPORTED as the JS module it is. Titles, blurbs
//    and ids come from the real array — no regex can drift away from it.
//  • PREVIOUS tag: only the ID SET is needed, and importing a historical file
//    would mean resolving ITS imports against TODAY's registries (renamed export
//    => crash while cutting a release). So ids are read from the old source text
//    with the same `^ {4}id: '` scan that whatsNew.test.js already asserts is
//    exhaustive ("no entry is swallowed by a merge"). Tolerant where it must be,
//    exact where it matters.
//
//  ── WHY --generate-notes IS GONE FROM release.yml ───────────────────────────
//  With no PRs it contributes exactly one useful line, the Full Changelog compare
//  link, wrapped in an empty "## What's Changed" heading that reads like a bug
//  next to a real changelog. We emit the compare link ourselves instead.
//
//  ── SILENCE IS THE DEFECT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A release with zero new entries FAILS here, loudly, before anything is built.
//  A pure-plumbing release is legitimate — say so on purpose by putting
//  [no-notes] in the annotated tag message. "Nothing to announce, on purpose"
//  and "the generator found nothing" must never look the same.
