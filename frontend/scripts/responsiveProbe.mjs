/* 📐 The guard rail the responsive work never had.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `canvasResponsive.test.js` and its siblings read the JSX as TEXT and match
 * class names against it. That was an honest compromise — `node --test` cannot
 * parse JSX and the suite renders nothing — but it means every one of those
 * assertions can be green while the screen is unusable. They can prove `h-10`
 * is WRITTEN. They cannot see a panel that is mostly air, a box wider than the
 * screen, a control overlapping another, a label cut in half, or a bar eating
 * half the fold.
 *
 * Three responsive regressions shipped through that gap in one week, each found
 * by a person looking at a phone. This script is the thing that should have
 * found them: it RENDERS the app at real device sizes, in each of the states a
 * surface can be in, and measures what came out.
 *
 * ── What it checks ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   overflow    nothing sticks out past the right edge of the viewport.
 *   budget      the fixed chrome may not eat the fold.
 *   fill        a panel's ROWS may not be mostly empty. This is what catches
 *               "technically it fits": a shelf whose rows each hold one small
 *               chip in a wide box is rows of air, and it reads as broken even
 *               though every box is inside every other box.
 *   truncated   a label cut by its own box is not a label. A box that fits
 *               BECAUSE its text was chopped passed every other check here.
 *   targets     every interactive control keeps its finger-sized height below
 *               the desktop breakpoint.
 *   overlap     no two elements of the fixed chrome may cover each other.
 *
 * Surfaces are found by attribute, never by class: `data-probe-chrome="<name>"`
 * (the fixed chrome, budgeted), `data-probe-panel` (rows measured for fill),
 * `data-probe-world` (a pannable surface whose contents are not overflow),
 * `data-probe-reading` (opened to READ — not budgeted) and `data-probe-layer`
 * (a lightbox or dialog that covers the page BY DESIGN — not budgeted, paired
 * with nothing in the overlap check). Pages: #/canvas, #/bank, #/datasets and
 * #/dataset/studio/<id>; anything else is measured at rest only.
 *
 * ── Running it ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   npm run probe:responsive -- --url http://127.0.0.1:5173/#/canvas
 *   npm run probe:responsive -- --url http://127.0.0.1:5173/#/bank

 *
 * Options: --viewports 360x800,844x390,1280x800   --states shelf,layouts
 *          --json   --quiet
 *
 * Exit codes are THREE, on purpose: 0 clean, 1 violations found, 2 could not
 * run. A probe that cannot run must never look like a probe that passed — the
 * silent skip is its own bug (it is how a privacy guard once passed for weeks
 * while checking nothing), so 2 is loud and separate from 0. For the same
 * reason every run prints what it COVERED: "no violations" over four surfaces
 * on an empty board is not the same answer as "no violations" over eleven.
