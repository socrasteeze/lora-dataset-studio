LoRA Dataset Studio turns one reference photo into a trained, ranked LoRA —
curation, captioning, face-scoring and training behind a single browser tab, on
your own machine. The useful part of LoRA training isn't the training; it's
building a clean, balanced, well-captioned image set. This app puts that whole
pipeline behind one UI.

> **In a hurry?** Launch the app, let the **Setup** wizard scan your machine,
> and create your first dataset from your own photos — no API key, no GPU, no
> external tool required for that first step.

---

## Two ways to run it

| | Curation-only | Full local |
|---|---|---|
| **What works** | Create datasets, import/scrape, curate, caption manually, export ZIP | Everything — plus local (Klein) generation, JoyCaption, face scoring, masks, training, Test Studio |
| **Needs** | Python 3.10–3.12 | ComfyUI and/or ai-toolkit + an NVIDIA GPU (12 GB+ for local generation) |
| **Good for** | Laptops, a first try, curating away from your GPU box | The full pipeline on a training rig |

You can start **curation-only** (import/scrape your own photos) and add the
local tools later — features light up automatically when their tool is
detected. This fork has no cloud API engines and no rented-GPU training: generation
and training both run on hardware you control.

## First launch

**Windows (one command):** download \`LoRA-Dataset-Studio-windows.zip\` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/releases/latest),
extract it, then double-click \`start.bat\`. Releases contain an archive/source, not
a prebuilt executable launcher. \`start.bat\` finds or downloads a compatible Python
(3.10–3.12), creates \`.venv\`, installs the requirements, starts the server, and
opens the app in your browser at the address it is actually serving on (default
\`http://127.0.0.1:5050/\`; a LAN/Tailscale \`server.host\` opens that address
instead, once the server is up — set \`LDS_NO_BROWSER=1\` to skip the auto-open).

**Any OS (manual venv):**

\`\`\`
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python backend/run.py
\`\`\`

**Pinokio (one click, any OS):** in [Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer), use
**Discover → Download from URL** with
\`https://github.com/socrasteeze/lora-dataset-studio.git\`, then **Install** and
**Start**. Pinokio creates the environment (\`env/\`), installs the core
requirements and opens Studio on the port it really bound. Two things to know:
the optional tools are still connected from **Setup**, and updates go through
Pinokio's **Update** tab — it runs the same \`git pull --ff-only\` as the in-app
updater. You do not have to remember that last part: the app recognises a
Pinokio launch and its Updates card shows *Stop → Update → Start* (with how many
commits behind you are) instead of the **Update & restart** button, which would
relaunch the server in a window Pinokio no longer tracks.

**Docker (curation-only):** \`cp .env.example .env\`, then \`docker compose up --build\`.
Image *generation* on this fork always needs ComfyUI locally — there are no
Gemini/OpenAI generation keys.

**Docker (GPU, with ComfyUI inside):** \`cp .env.example .env\`, then
\`mkdir -p run basedir data-docker-gpu bank-images\` — create those yourself, or Docker creates
them as \`root\` and the app cannot write to them — then
\`docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up --build\`. Needs an NVIDIA GPU and the
NVIDIA Container Toolkit; this is the only Docker option that can do Klein/Z-Image
generation and the Test Studio.

The CUDA 12.x compatibility minimum is driver **525.60.13 on Linux** or **528.33
on Windows/WSL**; for the default CUDA 12.9 image, use at least **575.51.03 on
Linux** or **576.02 on Windows**. The optional CUDA 13 image needs **R580+**.
If you reuse an existing ComfyUI tree, \`LDS_COMFY_BASEDIR\` must name the parent
that directly contains \`models/\`, \`input/\`, \`output/\` and \`custom_nodes/\`, not
the \`models/\` folder itself. Compose actively defaults DNS to \`1.1.1.1\`; set
\`LDS_DNS\` to your router or Pi-hole when internal hostnames matter.

Both ports are published on the host and remain reachable from the LAN. A
Settings restart is handled by the container supervisor and keeps the fixed
container bind. To update this Docker flavour, update and rebuild the image rather
than trying to replace \`/app\` in place:

\`\`\`
git pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d --build
\`\`\`

If \`/data\` or existing contents beneath it are not writable, \`LDS_FORCE_CHOWN=true\`
is the last resort: it recursively changes ownership only for the \`LDS_DATA\` mount,
never the ComfyUI or bank mounts.

The full install matrix (Windows release ZIP, GPU requirements, external tools)
lives in the README on GitHub.

## What is running on your machine {#architecture}

A full-local install is **three separate programs**, in **two folders**, on
**two ports**, with **two Python environments**. Nothing in the app used to say
so, and the cost of guessing is real: a user spent hours patching ai-toolkit's
own web UI — a component this app never talks to — while the actual problem was
one line of \`config.json\` (reported by strouder, GitHub #19).

| Component | Where | What it does | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LoRA Dataset Studio** (Flask) | the folder you extracted, **its own \`.venv\`** | The UI you are reading this in. Curation, captioning, and the thing that **starts and stops training**. | **5050** |
| **ai-toolkit** (\`run.py\`) | the folder you point at in Settings, **its own venv — the one with \`torch\`** | The training **engine**. It is run as a command-line process; it has no UI of its own. | — |
| ai-toolkit's Next.js UI (\`ui/\`) | inside the ai-toolkit folder | An **unrelated** web interface that ships with ai-toolkit. This app never launches it, never reads it, and never writes to it. | 8675 |

Two consequences worth remembering:

- **The Studio reads \`config.json\` and drives training.** That file belongs to
  this app (it sits in its data folder, and every key in it has a field in
  **Settings**). Editing anything inside ai-toolkit's \`ui/\` folder changes
  nothing here — if you ever find yourself editing \`ui/dist/…\`, you are in the
  wrong project.
- **The two Python environments are not interchangeable.** The Studio's \`.venv\`
  runs the web app; ai-toolkit's venv is the one that must have \`torch\` and the
  training dependencies. Settings ▸ Local tools ▸ **Python interpreter** is how
  you tell the app which interpreter is ai-toolkit's — and its **Test** button
  now checks that the interpreter can really \`import torch\`, not just that the
  file exists.

There is no process stacking to worry about on our side: the Studio is a single
Flask process, and starting a second one on the same port fails loudly instead
of running invisibly alongside the first.

### Supported Python versions {#python-versions}

- **LoRA Dataset Studio: Python 3.10 – 3.12.** \`start.bat\` finds or downloads
  one for you; the optional ML extras (insightface, onnxruntime, \`numpy<2\`)
  only publish wheels for those versions.
- **ai-toolkit: Python 3.11 is the safe choice.** On **3.13** its pinned
  \`scipy==1.12.0\` has no wheel, pip falls back to building from source and dies
  on a missing Fortran compiler (measured and reported by strouder, GitHub #19).
  On Windows, install **3.11.9** — it is the last 3.11 with a binary installer;
  later 3.11.x are source-only security releases.
- The two do **not** have to match. They are separate environments on purpose.

### If Hugging Face downloads fail {#hf-downloads}

If a base-model download dies with something that reads like a network error,
check whether \`HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1\` is set in your environment. That
turns on an optional fast-download accelerator which needs the \`hf_xet\` (or
\`hf_transfer\`) package installed **in the environment doing the downloading**;
without it, transfers abort with a misleading message. This app never sets that
variable — it comes from your shell, ai-toolkit's \`.env\`, or a ComfyUI launcher.
Either fix works: set \`HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=0\`, or \`pip install hf_xet\`.
The training failure panel now recognises this case and says so.
*(Reported by bobba84, GitHub #18.)*

## The Setup wizard

On first launch you land in **Setup**. It scans your machine automatically and
walks through four steps — each one unlocks a set of features:

1. **ComfyUI** — unlocks local (Klein) image generation and the Test Studio.
2. **Ollama** — the local vision model behind auto-captioning, framing
   auto-classify and head-crop.
3. **Quality tools** — face-similarity scoring, person masks, watermark
   inpainting and bank scoring (a one-click \`pip install\`).
4. **ai-toolkit** — the training engine.

Each optional helper says what it unlocks and what still works without it, and
installs on its own — or all at once, which is usually what you want on a fresh
machine.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../screenshots/setup/install-everything.png" alt="Setup step 4 listing each ML helper with its own Install button and an Install all option" width="760">
</p>

Nothing is mandatory: **Skip setup** is always available, and every step can be
revisited later from **Settings**, where each tool has a Test button that tells
you immediately whether the app can see it.

**Setup is a first run, not a toll gate.** Once the app has seen your install
working — configured, with at least one image engine answering — it stops
sending you to the wizard. Coming back later (a new tab, a new browser, another
machine on your network, or a restarted server) drops you straight into the app,
and the same checks the wizard runs happen in the background while you work. A
short line in the corner says so and then fades.

You are only interrupted when something that *used to* work has stopped —
an API key that no longer answers, an ML helper that no longer imports. The
warning names what broke and links to Setup. It does **not** fire because
ComfyUI or Ollama simply isn't running (you start those on demand), and it does
not fire because something was never installed in the first place. If you
removed a component deliberately, **That was on purpose** stops the app
mentioning it again.

## Around the app

- **Datasets** — the home tab and your **library**: photo tiles of every
  dataset, grouped by model family, with a search box and a badge for each
  family you've already trained. Create one and work it through the guided
  flow (source → curate → caption → train).
- **Runs** — every local training in one place: live progress, the settings
  each launch used, retry a failed run (↻), continue a finished one (▶), and
  download the LoRA (appears once ai-toolkit is set).
- **Test Studio** — grid-test a trained LoRA across checkpoints and strengths,
  vote, and rank (appears once ComfyUI is reachable).
- **Guide** — this manual.
- **Setup** — the guided wizard, re-runnable anytime.
- **Settings** — everything the wizard configures, plus server, updates,
  maintenance and the diagnostic report.

Next chapter: **Using the app** — the full walkthrough, dataset type by dataset
type.
`,D=`# Using the app

The workspace is a **guided flow**: each stage stays folded until the one
before it is done, and the progress rail on the left tells you where you are
and what's blocking the next step. You never have to guess what comes next —
this chapter just explains what each stage does and where the useful buttons
hide.

The walkthrough below follows a **character** dataset end to end because it
exercises the most stages; **concept**, **style** and the **image bank** each
get their own section after it. The flow is the same for all of them — only the
captioning rules and a few guards change with the dataset kind.

---

## The character walkthrough (reference photo → trained LoRA)

1. **Create the dataset** — Datasets → New. Pick **Character**, name it, set a
   **trigger word** (the token your prompts will use), and choose the **target
   model** (Z-Image / SDXL / Krea 2 / FLUX.1 / FLUX.2 Klein — changes the caption
   style; you can change it later).
2. **Upload the reference photo.** The app head-crops it automatically; use the
   crop editor (or *Reset to auto*) if the framing is off. Up to 3 extra angles
   can be added for multi-view consistency. **✦ Edit** retouches the reference
   itself from a prompt ("plain studio-grey background", "add glasses") and shows
   you a Before/After to Keep or Discard. It runs on **Klein** or **Krea 2 Edit**,
   on your own ComfyUI: free, private, and safe to repeat until it looks right.
   The two engines read different photos, and the dialog says which before you
   press Generate — Klein takes the dataset's extra angles to lock identity;
   Krea instead takes one image added in the edit dialog, trained as a different
   subject (another person, or a scene to place yours in). Do not use Krea's slot
   for another angle of the same face: that can duplicate the subject. An engine
   appears only when your ComfyUI can actually run it, and names the one missing
   thing when it nearly can. The edit runs on the server, so you can close the tab
   and come back to the Before/After.
3. **Generate variations** — fire the **variation catalog** on the local Klein
   engine: 53 shots across expression,
   angle, lighting, framing, outfit and background, each wrapped in an identity
   guard so the face stays the same person.
4. **Import** your own photos too (drag & drop) — each is auto-cropped to the
   face on the way in.
5. **Auto-classify framing.** A local vision model tags every image
   **face / bust / body / back**; the badges feed the composition meter.
6. **Curate** — keep / reject / crop, guided by the live meter targeting
   **12 face · 6 bust · 6 body · 1 back**. Watch the face-similarity badges
   (green = strong match, orange = review) to drop off-identity shots before
   they poison training.
7. **Caption** — one click captions the kept set (prose or booru tags,
   matched to the target model). The **identity-leak check** flags any caption
   that describes a trait currently set to Omit (face/eyes/skin, and by default
   hair). ⚙️ Options lets you Describe hair, makeup, facial hair or glasses so
   they stay prompt-controllable. Fix every flagged caption. A find/replace +
   tag-frequency panel sweeps the whole set at once; its **💾 Write .txt
   files** button drops a kohya-style \`<image>.txt\` next to each kept image
   in the dataset folder (same format as the export ZIP) for external tools.
8. **Fix individual shots** — every generated tile has a ✏ button: edit the
   exact prompt that made it and regenerate in place, without losing the rest.
9. **Train** — the pre-flight check runs the full checklist (count, balance,
   captions, leaks, duplicates). It no longer *blocks*: leaking captions and
   near-duplicates are editable right inside the confirm, and missing captions
   just ask you to **Start anyway** (captions stay strongly recommended). Steps
   are computed automatically; ⚙️ Advanced options exposes every knob (each with
   its own why/how) and a **Presets** row — apply a shipped ★ recipe (*Krea
   character*, *Concept*, *Style*) or save/import/export your own as a JSON.
   Training runs on your local GPU via ai-toolkit. Watch this run — and every
   other — from the **Runs** tab, where you can retry a failed run (↻),
   continue a finished run for more steps (▶), and download the LoRA.
10. **Pick the best checkpoint** — open the **Test Studio** from the dataset:
    grid-test checkpoint × strength, vote, rank by face similarity, and star ★
    the winning settings. The last checkpoint is almost never the best one.
11. **Export** — at any point, **Export ZIP** gives you the curated, captioned
    set as a standard ai-toolkit dataset. Nothing is locked in.

## Retry a reference edit

After an **✦ Edit** candidate appears, **Retry** repeats the exact prompt, selected
engine and temporary reference files used for that candidate. Use **Try another
prompt** only when you want to change the instruction. The candidate also names the
engine/API that actually returned it, so you can see which service produced the
image before you Keep or Discard it.

## Test a run straight from Runs

The **🏋️ Runs** hub is also a shortcut back to the right **Test Studio**. Every
active or recent run that still has a dataset shows **🧪 Test in Studio** beside
its actions. Click it to open Studio with that run’s dataset already selected —
there is no need to return to the library and find the dataset first. The button
is also available on a folded Recent dataset group, so you can start comparing
checkpoints without expanding its run history.

## Using a full model you trained

Training the **whole model** (rather than a LoRA adapter) produces something
different from a checkpoint, and **📦 Checkpoints & LoRAs** lists it in its own
**🧱 Full models** block for exactly that reason.

A delivered run leaves up to two files, and they are not interchangeable:

- the **full-precision master** (~26 GB). This is the only file you can train
  again or resume from. It is **never** sent to ComfyUI — 26 GB of a model folder
  to do a job the smaller file does better;
- the **fp8 twin** (~13 GB). This is the inference format: the file ComfyUI loads
  with **Load Diffusion Model**.

If the run has a master but no twin, **✨ Quantize to fp8** makes one. It works
whether the master is on this computer or only in the run's private Hugging Face
repository — in the second case it is downloaded first, with progress, and the
transfer can be stopped and resumed. Once the twin exists, **→ Send to ComfyUI**
puts it where ComfyUI looks. On the same drive that is a hard link: instant, and
it costs no extra disk space.

**🗑 Trash** moves one of those files to the app trash, so a mis-click on a file
that cost hours of GPU is recoverable.

**A run whose model is only on Hugging Face is not a lost run.** It shows
**☁ on Hugging Face** on the board and in its card, and the app refuses to remove
it: doing so would discard the only record of where that model is.

### Testing a full model

Once the fp8 twin is in ComfyUI, the **Test Studio** lists it as a base and
**🧪 Test in Studio** opens straight onto it, with its own sample settings filled
in. That matters: a full model trained here is **undistilled**, so it wants a
real CFG and a real step count (CFG 4 / 25 steps for Krea 2). The family's
few-step Turbo defaults render a blurry sketch on it that reads as a failed
training.

One limit worth knowing before you go looking for a button that is not there:
**the Test Studio is entered through a LoRA of the dataset.** A dataset trained
only as a full model has none, so it cannot open the Studio at all. If you have
any LoRA of that dataset deployed, pick it and set its **strength to 0** — no
LoRA node is added at 0, so you generate with the bare model.

## Merge a LoRA into a base checkpoint

This is the step between *"I trained a LoRA"* and *"I have a model to publish"*,
and it is how most of the community checkpoints you can download were actually
made. Of the Krea 2 checkpoints whose authors describe their method, the ones
that explain themselves describe a **merge**, not a training run: train a LoRA on
Raw, fold it into a base, quantize, upload.

You will find it in **📦 Checkpoints & LoRAs**, as **🧬 Merge a LoRA into a base
checkpoint**. Inside a full model's card the same tool appears with that model
already filled in as the base.

**Say what you are merging.** Pick a full-precision base, then add one or more
LoRAs, each with a weight. \`1.0\` applies a LoRA exactly as it was trained;
lower blends it in more gently; a negative weight subtracts it. Several LoRAs
stack — that is what "baked in LoRAs with balanced weights" means when you read
it on a model page.

**Nothing starts on the first click.** The plan is computed from the file headers
alone — no weight is read — and it tells you how many tensors change, exactly how
big the output is, which drive it lands on, roughly how long it takes, and what
happens if it fails. On a 26 GB Krea 2 base, a measured merge took **about two
minutes** and rewrote 256 of 430 tensors.

**Nothing is ever overwritten.** The result is written next to the base under a
new timestamped name, through a temporary file that is only renamed once the
merge finishes. A merge that fails, or that you stop, leaves the base, the LoRAs
and any earlier merge exactly as they were.

### It is a merged model, and it says so

The file's own metadata records that it came from a merge, which base it used,
which LoRAs at which weights, and when. That matters because **file names lie**,
and because on the model sites "finetune" is routinely used for exactly this
object — by authors who describe the merge themselves a sentence later. LDS does
not copy that vocabulary: what comes out of here is a base with LoRAs folded into
its weights, not a model that was trained as a whole, and the header keeps saying
so after the file is renamed or re-uploaded.

### Getting the speed back (the Turbo transplant)

A full-model run in this app targets **Raw**, which is undistilled and therefore
slow. Krea publishes a re-distillation LoRA for Turbo; merging it at **0.8-1.0**
into a model trained on Raw is the published route people use to get few-step
behaviour back, and it is how the same model ends up on the model sites in both a
Raw and a Turbo flavour.

**We have not tested this ourselves.** It is an approximation, not an identity —
generate a few comparisons before you publish anything on the strength of it.

### Merge first, quantize after

Merging into an **already quantized** file is refused, on purpose. It would
dequantize every weight, modify it and re-quantize it: lossy on the way in and
again on the way out, and the loss compounds each time somebody does it. Merge
into the full-precision (bf16) model, then quantize the merged result with the
fp8 tool — which is the order the refusal points you at.

### Two things it will tell you about, rather than hide

- **A LoRA that does not belong to the base** is refused before anything is
  written, naming the weights it expected to find. A LoRA trained for another
  model has nothing to merge into.
- **Tensors that are not part of the model** are reported, not dropped. Not every
  \`.safetensors\` contains only a model: one community Krea 2 file circulating
  today carries about 75 MB of an image in two tensors hiding under a legitimate
  name. Nothing we do not understand is modified — it is copied through, and the
  plan names it so you know it is there.

**What the merge needs:** the same Python that quantization uses — one with
\`torch\` available. If it is missing, the plan says so with the command to fix it,
before you click anything.

## The generation queue

Everything that renders locally goes through one queue: your ComfyUI runs a
single job at a time, whether it was asked for from a dataset, the Test Studio,
the Canvas or the Bank. So you do not have to wait for one thing to finish
before starting the next — launch an **✨ Upscale & improve** batch, then a
**⚡ Generate**, then a retry on a tile, and they line up and run in turn.

The dock in the bottom-left corner is that queue. It appears only when there is
something in it, and shows, top to bottom: what the GPU is working on right now,
then what is waiting behind it, in the order it will be taken. Each line names
where the job came from and which dataset it belongs to, so two datasets feeding
the same queue are never confused for one another.

Two buttons per line:

- **↑** sends a waiting job to the front. Only the wait can be re-ordered — a
  job already on the GPU has nothing left to re-order, and says so.
- **✕** cancels that one job. This is not **⏹ Stop generation**, which ends a
  whole batch: cancelling here drops a single job and leaves its tile marked
  failed, and **Retry** on that tile queues it again.

Some jobs cannot be cancelled from the dock, and say who owns them instead: a
watermark inpaint belongs to the 🧽 Clean watermarks pass, and a reference edit
to the ✦ Edit reference panel. Both are being waited on by the pass that started
them, and each has its own Stop where it lives. A **paused** line means ComfyUI
stopped answering — that one is resolved from the recovery banner at the top of
the screen, not from here.

Two things still take the GPU exclusively and are not queued behind anything:
a training run, and a vision pass (captioning, framing, face analysis). While
one of those is running, new generations wait for it and the app says so.

## The Gallery (every image you generated)

**🖼 Gallery** in the top bar is one feed of everything the app ever rendered —
Test Studio cells, Canvas previews, comparison runs and ✨ Upscale & improve
results — across every dataset at once, newest first. The per-checkpoint
galleries answer "what did this training produce"; this page answers "what did
I make".

Narrow it from the row above the grid: one dataset, **Renders** or
**✨ Improved** only, or **👍 Liked** — the images you rated up in the Test
Studio. The count always names what the grid is actually showing. The feed
loads itself as you scroll towards its end; the **Load more** button at the
bottom states how many are left and still works as a plain button.

Tap any image to open the viewer — the same one the Canvas uses, with
everything the picture was made from: seed (copyable), checkpoint, base model,
sampler, CFG, the always-on LoRAs it was generated with, and the full prompt.
The **‹ ›** buttons (or the ← → keys) walk the feed without closing it; tap
the picture to put the details away, double-tap to magnify.

From the viewer you can also:

- **⬇ Download** — the file lands under a name that still says which dataset,
  run, step and seed made it.
- **✨ Upscale & improve** — Klein (re-renders detail; sharper, but skin can
  shift) or SeedVR2 (upscales and keeps the look). The result arrives at the
  top of this gallery as its own ✨ image; the original is untouched. The
  amber note under the buttons is where the Klein instruction is edited in
  place, the Klein model is chosen, a **LoRA preset** can be chained into
  every improve and the **output size (MP)** picked — all app-wide, the same
  values Settings shows.
- **↩ Use these improve settings** — on a ✨ result you like: the
  instruction, LoRA preset, strength, steps, output size and model that made
  THIS image become the app-wide improve settings again, so the next
  improves run the same way. Every new improvement records what it ran
  with; older images restore what they carry, and the toast names exactly
  which parts were applied.

**Select** at the bottom turns on selection mode: tap the misses, then
**🗑 Delete** (files go to the recycle bin or the app Trash — and the rows
leave the Test Studio too, which the confirmation says before anything is
armed), or **⬇ ZIP** to download the picked images as one archive under their
lineage names.

## Recover a paused Test Studio batch

If ComfyUI drops while Test Studio is processing a batch, the affected tile says
**paused** and shows its paste-safe reason. The queue deliberately stops there:
it does **not** submit or start a later job, so nothing else runs against a
recovered or different ComfyUI state.

First recover or restart ComfyUI. For a valid local portable install,
**Setup → ComfyUI → ▶ Start ComfyUI** uses the app's fixed local-safe profile.
It does not read, change or execute any \`.bat\` file; your existing launcher and
its settings stay untouched. Once ComfyUI is responding, **Cancel** the paused
batch and resume it from Studio. That makes the next prompt an explicit choice,
never an automatic continuation.

## Concept datasets (an object or action, not a person)

Pick **Concept** at creation and describe the concept in the required field —
the captioner needs to know exactly *what to omit*. What changes vs character:

- **No reference photo.** Images come from **import** or the built-in
  **scraper** (paste a gallery URL or run a Reddit keyword search, tick the
  frames you want, they land straight in the dataset — deduplicated and
  quality-filtered). Already have a kohya-style dataset on disk (images +
  same-name \`.txt\` captions)? **⋯ More → 📂 Import from folder…** merges it in
  from a pasted folder path — captions attach, duplicates are skipped (a ZIP
  works too, via **📦 Import dataset**). On gallery sites (PornPics), a category/tag/search scan
  shows **the same previews the listing page does** — one per gallery, the shot
  that actually matches your keyword. Tick **Scan full albums** to pull every
  photo of each matched gallery instead, or paste a single \`/galleries/…\` URL
  to get that whole album. Sex.com works the same way for keyword searches
  (\`sex.com/en/pics?search=…\`) — every pin **is** a single matching image, so
  there is no album option to worry about. Civitai searches return **SFW
  results only** unless you add a Civitai API key in **Settings → Scraping &
  sources**.

  > **Reddit says "wait N seconds" (429)?** By default Reddit scans share a
  > public client id (and its ~1000 requests / 10 min quota) with many other
  > people, so it can be exhausted before your first scan. Add your own free
  > client ID in **Settings → Scraping & sources** — a one-minute, step-by-step
  > guide is built into that page.
- **Captions invert**: they describe everything *except* the concept, so the
  concept is what binds to the trigger. The leak check watches for stray
  descriptions of it.
- **Person masking is off** (a person mask would erase the very thing you're
  teaching), and imports keep the full frame instead of head-cropping.
- **You can mask the faces instead** — the opposite polarity. *Advanced training
  options ▸ Mask faces* weighs the detected faces down in the loss so the concept
  learns the act, not the people demonstrating it, and you can preview exactly what
  it would cover before training. Off by default. See the dataset guide, §8.

## Style datasets (a global aesthetic)

Pick **Style** at creation. What changes:

- **No trigger word** — the style tints every image once the LoRA is loaded.
- **Captions describe content only** (never the rendering), and they're
  optional; caption dropout rises so the style generalizes.
- **Step count switches to a sublinear √n scale** built for the large sets
  (hundreds of images) style LoRAs want.

## Caption your images in another tool

You are not locked into the captioners shipped here. The round trip is:

1. **⬇ Export ZIP** from *Import & export*. The archive is a plain kohya layout —
   one folder of \`image.png\` + same-name \`image.txt\` pairs. If some kept images
   have no caption yet, the app asks before exporting instead of refusing:
   confirm and their \`.txt\` files come out empty, ready to be filled.
2. **Caption them wherever you like.** Any tool that writes a \`<image>.txt\`
   sidecar next to each image works — that is the convention this app reads,
   whatever the file names are and whatever folder depth you use.
3. **📦 Import dataset (ZIP)** (or **📂 Import from folder…**) with the same
   images and their new \`.txt\` files. Images already in the dataset are **not
   duplicated**: their caption lands on the row that already holds them, and the
   toast says how many were applied.

Two things worth knowing before you start:

- **A caption you already wrote here is never overwritten.** Re-importing only
  fills the empty ones; the toast reports the rest as *"kept the caption written
  here"*. Clear a caption in the app first if you want the external one to win.
- **Only the caption travels back.** Statuses, scores and framing stay as they
  are here — the returning archive is read as captions for images you already
  have, not as a replacement dataset.

**A Style dataset asks louder, on purpose.** A Style LoRA learns everything its
captions do *not* name, so an empty \`.txt\` teaches it nothing; the export
confirmation says so before letting you through. Cancelling takes you straight
to the captions instead.

## Krea and the shape of your reference photo

**Krea 2 Edit now follows the framing of the selected shot card** during dataset
generation. The reference photo still anchors identity, but Krea's v1.2 Fit path
adapts it to the requested output: **1:1** for face cards and **3:4** for bust,
body and back cards. A square reference therefore no longer forces a full-body or
sitting card into a tight bust crop.

This is deliberately limited to Krea dataset variations. The separate **Edit
reference** action keeps the source layout for a free-form edit, while Klein and
the API engines keep their existing, separate generation paths.

You can still crop a reference when you want a different identity anchor or
composition, but you no longer need to crop it merely to give a selected body
card enough vertical room. Reference quality still matters for likeness; the
selected card now owns the output frame.

## Your own shot catalog (JSON import)

The workspace ships a built-in shot catalog per subject type (53 shots for a
human, ~59 for an animal, 55 for an anime character, and so on). If you want shots nobody wrote for you —
40 breed-specific poses for a dog, a product line's signature angles — you don't
have to type them one at a time. Open **📥 Shot catalog (JSON)** under the shot
grid.

**Export first.** The exported file is the format, and the example an LLM needs:

\`\`\`json
{
  "format": "lds-shots/1",
  "subject_type": "animal",
  "shots": [
    {
      "label": "Dog, zoomies on the lawn",
      "framing": "body",
      "prompt": "full body photo of the animal running fast across a lawn, side view, sunny day"
    }
  ],
  "examples": []
}
\`\`\`

Then ask a chat assistant for more shots *in that exact shape*, and import the
file it gives you.

Each shot needs three things:

- **\`label\`** — a short name, max 80 characters, shown on the card. It must be
  unique: not a built-in label (of *any* subject type), and not one of your
  existing shots. The app refuses a collision and tells you which label is at
  fault — two shots sharing a label would make it resolve the wrong prompt the
  day you regenerate one.
- **\`framing\`** — exactly one of \`face\`, \`bust\`, \`body\`, \`back\`. Anything else is
  refused; it is never quietly remapped.
- **\`prompt\`** — the text sent to the image engine, max 500 characters.

\`nsfw: true\` is optional and only has an effect when Klein is the only engine
checked. Everything under **\`examples\`** is ignored on import — that's how the
export can show you samples without them coming back as duplicates. Any other
field (including \`aspect\`) is ignored too, and the import summary says so: an
imported shot uses its framing's default aspect ratio.

**Nothing is written until you confirm.** The app reads the file, lists what
would land and what it refuses (naming the entry and the reason), and waits. A
40-shot file whose 37th entry is broken never leaves 36 shots half-imported.

Imported shots appear in their own **📥 Imported** group after the built-ins, one
set per subject type. They never replace a built-in, you can delete them one by
one or all at once, and they're stored with the app — not in the browser — so
they survive a cache wipe, show up on your phone and ride along in the backup.

### Keeping a shot you wrote by hand

The **✨ Custom shot** box below the grid is the quick way to add one shot: type a
prompt, pick a framing, Add. Those cards are stored **in your browser**, so
clearing its data takes them with it.

Any card you want to keep, press **Keep** on it. It moves into the 📥 Imported
group and is saved with the app, exactly like an imported shot — surviving a
cache wipe, following you to another device, included in the backup. The card
keeps its identity, so a shot preset that had it selected still works. If its
label happens to clash with a built-in shot or with one you already imported, the
app says which label and refuses rather than creating a duplicate; rename the
card (remove it and add it again) and press **Keep** once more.

## Back up everything

The **💾 Back up everything** button on the Datasets library packs your whole
setup into a single file so you can move to a new machine — or recover from one
— without losing anything.

- **What's inside**: every dataset (all images, captions, statuses, face and
  watermark states, references), its **training history** (which runs produced
  which version, the settings each used), plus your **settings** — engine
  choices, training defaults, watermark preferences. It's a
  *logical* backup, one entry per dataset, not a raw disk dump.
- **Include trained LoRAs** (checkbox next to the button): also bundle the
  trained \`.safetensors\` files themselves. These are large — hundreds of MB per
  checkpoint — so it's **off by default**; the light training history above is
  always included, so a dataset comes back under **Trained** either way. Tick it
  when you want the finished LoRAs to travel too.
- **What's never inside**: your **API keys, Hugging Face token and scraping
  credentials**. They are deliberately left out so the file is safe to copy
  around; re-enter them once on the new install.
- **How it runs**: in the background. A library can be gigabytes, so you get a
  live "X / N datasets" progress bar and can keep working. When it's done, use
  **⬇ Download** to save the archive, or **📂 Open folder** to find it on disk.
- **Restoring**: hand the master archive to the same **📦 Import backup** button.
  It restores your settings (without overwriting keys you've already entered),
  rebuilds each dataset **and its training history** — so it lands back under
  **Trained** instead of "Not trained yet", with its runs in the Runs hub.
  Bundled LoRA files are re-deployed to ComfyUI when it's configured on the new
  machine; if it isn't, they're reported as skipped and the **Trained** status
  still stands (the run is what marks it trained, not the file on disk). Nothing
  is ever overwritten — a dataset whose name already exists comes back with a
  \`(restored)\` suffix — and you get an honest final report of what was restored,
  renamed or skipped.

## The image bank (triage a big folder)

You exported 9 000 unsorted images from Telegram (or a scraper dumped a
mountain of files) and a dataset only needs the best 30–150 of them. The
**🗃️ Bank** tab is the triage funnel that gets you there — without ever
touching the folder itself.

**Where things are on that screen.** A bank you open is laid out in three
parts, and knowing which is which saves reading the rest of this section twice:

- a **top bar** with the bank's name, its counters, and the four actions that
  change what leaves the bank — **⚙ Passes**, **🚀 Launch all**, **⬆ Promote**
  and **🗑 Delete rejected from disk**;
- a **filter rail** down the left: the search, the exclude box, the subfolder
  picker, the person and style strips, and the chips. The six measured axes
  (Score, Framing, Medium, Angle, Resolution, Origin) sit behind **🎛 More
  filters** so the everyday ones stay on one screen. On a narrow window the rail
  becomes a drawer you open with **☰ Filters**, and it remembers whether you
  keep it open. On a wide window the rail stays put as you scroll the grid, so
  the chips are still there ten thousand images down;
- the **grid** filling the rest, with the selection actions directly above it.

The analysis passes live **inside ⚙ Passes** rather than across the top of the
page: they are the step you run once per bank and then leave alone for days, and
they were taking up the third of the screen the images now use. All eight are
still there, and each still opens its own window with its own scope and counts —
only the door changed. On a bank with nothing scanned yet the panel opens by
itself, because there is nothing else to do first — **on a desktop-width window
only**. Measured at 360 px it is about 1 500 px tall, so opening itself there put
the first image two screens down; below that width ⚙ Passes stays a button you
press. Below it, the panel also folds everything that is not a pass button — the
semantic engine, watermarks, edits and the overview each sit behind their own
named fold, one tap away — because the pass buttons are what you came for.

The funnel itself:

1. **Create a bank** — give it a name and paste the folder path. The app
   inventories every image in place (subfolders included). Nothing is copied,
   nothing is modified; rejecting an image is a reversible status, never a file
   deletion. If your folder is really a *folder of folders* (a Telegram export
   with one subfolder per chat, say), tick **One bank per subfolder** and each
   top-level subfolder becomes its own bank — so you can curate, queue and
   promote each one separately. A preview shows exactly which banks will be made
   and how many images each holds; loose images sitting directly in the parent
   get their own bank too, so nothing is dropped. **Untick any subfolder in that
   preview to leave it out of this import** — a rendered-output folder, a backup,
   the 40 000-file archive you do not want triaged. Excluded folders stay on the
   list struck through (so you can see what you skipped rather than wonder what
   the walk missed), and they are not read at all rather than read and then
   discarded. The exclusion applies to *that import*: each bank created is rooted
   at its own subfolder, so nothing you excluded can reappear later. If you tick
   off **every** subfolder the app says so before you press the button — it will
   make the loose-files bank if there is one, and refuse outright if there is
   not, rather than quietly importing the whole parent folder instead. The folder
   stays LIVE: keep dropping images into it and they are picked up as undecided
   images ready for the next scan — your existing keep/reject decisions, scores
   and captions are never touched. The bank LIST does not re-check the folders by
   itself any more: on a big library that was a full inventory of every image on
   disk each time you walked past the page. It tells you how fresh its counts
   are, and **🔄 Rescan folders** checks them all on demand ("42 new image(s)
   found in the folder"). Opening one bank still walks that bank's own folder, so
   its own count is always current the moment you look at it. A folder that went
   missing (unplugged drive, renamed folder) is still flagged from the list
   without any rescan. Files you removed from the folder are reported at the top
   of the bank, never deleted from it, so an unplugged drive can't wipe your
   triage. One bank holds up to **200,000 images**; past that the refresh adds as
   many as fit and tells you how many it left out, so nothing you already
   triaged stops working. That ceiling counts what is in the folder now — files
   you deleted from it don't count against it.
1bis. **🕸 Scrape the web into a bank** — you don't need a folder you prepared
   by hand. Unfold **🕸 Scrape the web into a bank** on the bank list, choose a
   destination (a **new bank**, or **add to an existing one**), then scan a
   gallery URL and pick images exactly as you would for a dataset. They are
   downloaded into that bank's own folder and inventoried on the spot.

   Two things are worth knowing, because they are the whole point:

   - **Nothing is filtered on the way in.** Scraping straight into a *dataset*
     applies training-grade gates (short side ≥ 768 px, ratio ≤ 3:1, perceptual
     de-duplication) *before* anything is stored. A bank is the step **before**
     that judgement: "too small", "near-duplicate" and "wrong framing" are
     verdicts its own passes produce, with thresholds you move. So the bank
     stores what it downloaded and lets you decide. If you already know what you
     are collecting, scraping straight into a dataset is still the shorter road.
   - **A second scrape resumes the same bank.** Pick *Add to an existing bank*
     and the new images join the pile — nothing is replaced, and no triage
     decision you already made is reset. Re-downloading the exact same file
     lands on the same name instead of piling up copies; that is file identity,
     not a duplicate verdict (the bank's own passes own that word).

   The rest of the funnel is unchanged: scan, cull, promote into a dataset.
2. **🔎 Scan quality** — a background pass (CPU only, a few minutes even on
   thousands of images) scores every file: sharpness, noise, flat/empty
   frames, resolution — and groups **near-duplicates**. The flags follow the
   thresholds in *Settings → Captioning & quality*; because the raw scores are
   stored, tuning a threshold re-sorts the bank instantly, no rescan. The same
   pass also answers two questions the file itself lies about — see
   *Is this image really what it says it is?* below.
3. **Cull** — use the filter chips (Blurry, Noisy, ⬜ Flat, Small,
   🧇 Soft detail, 🎞 Black bars, ≈ Duplicates) to review the worst
   offenders first. **🧹 Auto-reject
   flagged…** clears whole categories in one click (your manual ✓/✕ are never
   flipped). The number beside each checkbox is what *that click* would reject —
   still-undecided images only, which is why it is usually smaller than the
   count on the matching filter chip: the chip shows every image carrying the
   flag, including the ones a previous auto-reject already threw away — and it
   counts them **inside whatever else you have filtered**, so it always states
   the size of the page it opens. (Each chip is measured with your other filters
   applied and its own value lifted, so picking one never blanks its
   neighbours, and a chip stays on offer even when it holds nothing under the
   current filter. The auto-reject number stays whole-bank on purpose: that pass
   runs over the bank, not over the view.) Run it
   twice and the second run legitimately says **0 to reject**: there is nothing
   left it is allowed to touch. A flag also warns when its pass never ran, and
   the panel says how many images have **never been scanned** — those are
   invisible to every quality flag until 🔎 Scan measures them, which is not the
   same thing as being clean. In the Duplicates view, resolve every group at
   once with **keep best** (highest resolution, then sharpest) or **keep
   first**, or pick the keeper by eye.
4. **👥 Group by person** — the face pass (needs the Quality tools from Setup)
   detects the dominant face of every remaining image and clusters the bank by
   person, *no reference photo needed*. Click a person card to see only them,
   select all, keep or reject. Embeddings are cached, so re-running after a
   cull is much faster.
5. **🔖 Tags** — the cheap way to slice the pile. A small local model (WD14,
   ~400 MB, installed from *Setup ▸ Quality tools*) labels every non-rejected
   image with **booru tags** — \`blonde_hair\`, \`red_dress\`, \`outdoors\` — and the
   filter bar gains tidy dropdowns for hair, clothing, headwear, setting, pose
   and how many people, plus an **All other tags** list so nothing the model
   found is hidden. They compose with every other filter, and the **search box
   matches them too**, so \`red dress\` works before you have captioned anything.
   The point is the order of operations: captioning a 9 000-image dump costs
   hours of GPU time, and you would be paying it *before* knowing which images
   you want. Tag first, throw most of it away, caption the survivors. It runs
   fine on the **CPU**, so it works on a machine that cannot host a captioning
   model, and it **never writes a caption** — the tags live in their own place
   and the captioner below is untouched. **Limits, plainly:** it is a
   *classifier*, not a describer — it names things it was trained on and will
   miss the rest; the facet dropdowns are curated shortcuts over a partial list
   of known tags, which is why All other tags exists; it is available in the
   **bank only**, not in the dataset workspace; and unlike the other heavy
   passes it **cannot run on a compute peer** — Launch all will refuse it there
   rather than fail an hour in.
6. **🏷️ Caption & 🔍 search** — caption the bank with the same engines your
   datasets use (JoyCaption / Ollama vision, your *Settings*). Hit **🏷️ Caption
   all** to describe every not-yet-captioned image, or select some first to
   caption just those. It runs in the background, frees the GPU like the other
   passes, and is Stop-able mid-run. The captions are plain descriptions (no
   trigger word, nothing omitted) whose real job is **search**: type into the
   search box — \`red dress\`, \`sunset\`, a file name — and the grid filters to
   matching images, combinable with every other filter. It's the fast way to
   find shots in a 9 000-image dump.
7. **⬆ Promote** — the kept images are **copied** into the dataset you choose —
   or into one **created on the spot**, so the last step of the funnel no longer
   sends you to the Datasets page and back — through the normal import path: normalized to webp, near-duplicates already
   in the dataset skipped. Any bank caption **rides along**, so a captioned
   selection starts already captioned in the dataset. From there they get
   everything datasets have — captions, watermark cleaning, face scoring against
   a reference, training.

Work the funnel in that order: quality first (cheap, catches the trash), then
subject, then selection. A promoted image keeps its ⬆ badge in the bank so you
always know what's been used where.

**Keeping the list readable.** A bank is named once, at creation — and *One bank
per subfolder* names them after the folders — so the list gets unwieldy fast.
Click the **✎** next to a bank's name to rename it: only the label changes, the
source folder, the images and every ✓/✕ stay exactly where they are. The **Sort**
menu above the cards reorders the list (newest or oldest first, name A→Z or Z→A,
most images, least triaged) and remembers your choice between visits.

**You can curate while a pass is running.** Opening another bank and accepting or
rejecting images while a scan — or the whole Launch-all queue — is working is
supported and safe. If a save happens to land at the exact moment a pass is
writing, the app waits and replays it for you; in the rare case it still can't
get through you'll see "the database is busy… try again in a moment", and
clicking again is all it takes. Your decision is never partially applied.

**🎨 Curate down to the right subset.** Culling removes the bad shots; curation
picks the *good* subset — and it's most of what makes a LoRA good. Once **✨
Score** has run (the default CLIP semantic index), or the Bank's optional
**SigLIP 2 semantic index** is ready, the **Curate** row under the selection bar
offers two selectors that cost no extra inference:

- **🎨 Pick diverse** — enter a number and it selects the images that best
  *cover the variety* of what you're looking at (varied angles, outfits, scenes),
  instead of that many near-identical frames. It's the antidote to a dump of
  4 000 shots of the same pose: ask for 60 and you get 60 that actually differ.
  **Skip the odd ones out** (the slider under the number) is why they are the
  *right* 60. "Most varied" is computed as "farthest from everything already
  picked", and the image that is farthest from everything in a collected bank is
  usually not a nice unusual shot of your subject — it's the meme, the screenshot,
  the botched frame, the one photo of somebody else. The slider discounts an image
  for being *alone in the bank*: at the default **50%** an image that resembles
  nothing else has to be far more interesting than a normal one to earn a slot,
  and at **100%** it is all but excluded. It never works the other way round —
  anything as typical as the median of the bank is left completely alone, so this
  cannot turn your 60 into 60 look-alikes. Set it to **0** for the pure-coverage
  behaviour the button had before this setting existed. On a very large bank the
  first click takes a few seconds (it reads every image's neighbourhood once);
  the button says *Sampling…* while it does.
- **⚖ Balanced pick** — see [Pick a balanced set](#pick-a-balanced-set) below: the
  same sampling, but spread evenly over your **framings** instead of taken off
  the top of one ranking.
- **🎯 Similar to selected** — select **one** image as a reference, and it ranks
  everything by how much it looks like that image and selects the closest N — the
  fast way to pull one person or one look out of a mixed export.

Both honour whatever filter and 🔍 search are active ("the 60 most diverse of
*this* subfolder"), and both just **select** — the images light up and you review
them with the same ✓ Keep / ✕ Reject / ⬆ Promote bar. Nothing is auto-kept or
deleted, so a selection you don't like costs one click to clear.

**📐 Classify framing** tags every non-rejected image by *shot type* — face
close-up, bust, full body or back view — using the same detector the datasets
use. The result becomes a row of **📐 Framing** filter chips (compose with every
other filter and search), so balancing a character set's angles is a couple of
clicks. It's a GPU vision pass; add it to **🚀 Launch all** to have it run
overnight with the rest.

**📊 Coverage advice** (idea by [@antonp](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio))
is a read-only panel next to the Curate row. From what you've **kept** (or every
non-rejected image before you've kept anything), it says in plain sentences what
leans and what's thin for a good LoRA — *"70% face shots, add body/back"*,
*"person #1 is 60% of the set — one subject or a mix?"*, *"only 8 kept, most
families want 20+"*. It's **advice only** — nothing is kept or rejected — and
pure maths on data the passes already computed, so it costs no GPU. The
framing-balance line needs the 📐 Framing pass to have run; without it the panel
still covers person mix, style spread and resolution and hints to run framing.

Those are all **labels**, and labels have a blind spot: they cannot tell two
hundred near-identical shots from two hundred different ones, and they say
nothing about outfits, lighting or camera angle. Two things you may already have
on disk can, so the panel also reads them when they exist:

- **Visual spread**, from the Bank's selected semantic index. It reports
  the average similarity across the pool — *"91% average similarity — a set this
  repetitive teaches one look"*. The bands were calibrated by measuring real
  banks: an ordinary one sits near 65%, an image plus its nearest neighbours
  lands around 79-90% with CLIP. SigLIP 2 has its own score distribution, so LDS
  shows its measured similarity but deliberately gives it no *varied/alike* band
  until that engine has been calibrated on real Banks. Without the selected index
  it says **Not measured** — never "varied", because nothing looked.
- **Caption variety**, from the captions the 🏷️ pass wrote, read by the same
  lexicon the dataset Coverage panel uses. It reports which camera views,
  lightings, settings, outfits and expressions your captions mention and which
  they never do.

Both limits are on the panel, not just here. The caption read looks at **words,
not pixels**: a profile shot the captioner never called a profile is invisible,
and *"not smiling"* still counts as a smile. A bank has no character/concept/style
kind the way a dataset does, so it is judged as a **character source** — the same
assumption the framing target and the person-mix advice already make.

The advice becomes a gesture with **⚖️ Pick a balanced set** at the bottom of
the panel — see [Pick a balanced set](#pick-a-balanced-set).

**🗑 Delete rejected from disk** (next to Promote) is the one exception to the
"your source folder is never modified" rule, and it's opt-in. Once you're happy
with your triage, it removes every image you marked ✕ rejected from its source
folder — the actual files, not just the status. It asks you to type **DELETE**
first, and tells you where the files will go before you confirm: your OS trash
when [\`send2trash\`](https://pypi.org/project/Send2Trash/) is installed, the
app's own Trash otherwise (recoverable until you empty it from Settings), and a
permanent delete only when neither can take the file. Kept and undecided images
are never touched, and a file it can't remove (locked, read-only) is reported
and left alone rather than aborting the batch.

It runs as a normal bank pass: the confirmation closes straight away and the
progress bar at the top of the bank counts the files as they go, with a **Stop**
that takes effect between files. Stopping is safe — whatever already left the
disk has left the bank too, and the rest are still marked ✕ for a second run.

⚠️ A bank doesn't own its folder, so two banks can point at nested folders and
list the **same files**. That's harmless while you triage — decisions live on
the bank — but deleting from disk in one bank removes those files from the other
too, along with every decision you made on them there. The app says so when you
create such a bank, and the confirmation names the other bank and how many of
its files are about to disappear.

**🚀 Launch all** does the whole funnel for you in one go. Tick which passes
run and how auto-reject behaves, hit Go, and walk away — it chains *scan →
auto-reject → score → find watermarks → group by person → classify framing →
(optional) caption* in that exact order. Auto-reject starts with only
**≈ Duplicates** on (keep the best, reject the rest); Blurry / Noisy / Flat /
Small are there, off, so an overnight run does not bin soft or plain shots
unless you tick them. Two things make it safe to run overnight: a pass whose
tool isn't installed, or a moment when the GPU is busy with a training run, is
**skipped with a reason** instead of failing the whole run; and because
auto-reject runs *before* the heavy passes, scoring/watermarks/person only ever
process the survivors, never the images you just rejected. Captioning is the one
pass left **off by default** (it's the slowest GPU pass and a clean-up run
rarely needs a description on every shot). Stop it any time — and when you come
back, a saved report at the top of the bank tells you exactly what ran, what was
skipped and why, with the headline counts.

**Running it on another machine.** The **Run on** picker at the bottom of the
dialog sends the heavy passes to a joined compute peer: ✨ Score, 👥 Group by
person, 🚩 Find watermarks, 📐 Classify framing and 🏷️ Caption can all travel.
🔎 Scan, 🧹 Auto-reject and ✂ Find crops & variants never do — they read this
machine's database and embeddings cache, so sending them would be slower.

**Each bank card says what has been done to it.** A row of pass badges shows a
muted glyph for a finished pass and an amber one with a count for what is left —
so "has this bank ever had a face pass" is answerable without queueing one to
find out. **Queue all banks** now uses the same answer twice: a bank is eligible
when a *selected* pass still has work (a fully triaged bank that was never
face-passed used to be invisible to it), and each bank is queued only with the
passes it actually needs. A bank with nothing left is skipped by name, with the
reason. Two passes are never treated as done — 🧹 Auto-reject is cheap and just
re-applies the current flags, and ✂ Find crops & variants is bank-global with no
cheap per-image answer, so both always run rather than guess.

**Work already done is not done twice.** ✨ Score and 👥 Group by person keep an
embeddings cache per bank, and that cache now travels: the other machine is sent
what this one already has, so it only computes the rest — and the images it
already covers are not uploaded at all. An image edited since it was scored is
sent again, because its signature no longer matches. Pressing **Stop** on a
remote pass now waits a couple of minutes for the other machine to hand back
what it finished, and the bank says how much was kept; relaunching carries on
from there rather than starting over. If it has already gone offline, the pass
stops with nothing kept and says so.

The **Analysis passes** row inside a bank has its own **Run on** picker, so
clicking ✨ Score, 👥 Group by person, 📐 Classify framing or 🏷️ Caption on its
own goes to the same machine Launch all would use. It remembers its choice
separately from the watermark panel further down the page. That panel carries
**two** pickers, because it asks two different questions: **Level 1 scan** picks
the machine that looks for watermarks (a vision pass, like the others), while
**Level 3 engine** picks the machine that *renders* the Klein repaint — which
can be a bare ComfyUI backend that could not run a vision pass at all. Level 2,
the crop, is local file work and never travels.

Each of the five travels **only if that machine reports the stack for it**. Pick
a peer and the passes it cannot run are greyed out, unticked and unclickable,
each saying what is missing — a peer with Ollama but no scoring extra offers
framing, watermarks and captions but not Score. Pick **this machine** again and
they become selectable. Captions follow the same rule: with a peer selected they
run there or not at all, on whichever captioner that machine has (JoyCaption if
it has it, otherwise Ollama). Queueing refuses the same combination, so a screen
left open since before the peer changed gets a message rather than a run that
fails an hour in. A peer that has joined but not checked in yet is still
offered — it only gets a note saying it hasn't reported what it can run.

Got several banks to clean? Instead of babysitting them one at a time, open a
bank's Launch-all dialog from the Banks page and choose **Add to queue**. The
**Launch-all queue** works through the banks one at a time **on each machine**,
each one waiting its turn for the GPU rather than failing when another bank — or
a training run — is using it. A panel on the Banks page shows what's running and
what's lined up, names the machine each bank will run on, and lets you cancel a
bank or clear the whole queue. Queue three exports before bed and they'll be
triaged by morning.

**One lane per machine.** Everything aimed at this computer runs strictly in
order — two banks never share the graphics card. A bank you sent to a compute
peer gets its own lane and runs *alongside* local work instead of behind it,
which is the whole reason to have a second machine. One lane per peer, no more:
a peer takes one job at a time, so a second lane would just queue over there
where this panel cannot see it.

Two banks that share a name are **one card**, and the queue keeps them one: however
they are spread across machines, only one of them ever runs at a time. A single
card cannot honestly show two different states at once.

**⏳ Queue all N bank(s)…** does the whole library in one gesture. It picks every
bank with work left for a pass you ticked, asks which passes to run, and adds one
queue entry per bank — carrying only the passes that bank actually needs. A bank
with nothing left is skipped by name, with the reason. The old rule was "has
undecided images", which hid a fully triaged bank that had never been
face-passed — exactly the bank worth re-targeting. Untick **skip passes a bank
has already had** for a deliberate re-run; that also widens the selection back to
every bank. It **queues**; twelve banks never become twelve runs — at most one
per machine is going at a time.
The confirmation says so with the count, and every bank is still cancellable
from the queue panel. A bank already in the queue is skipped by name rather than
counted twice.

**And you will be told if the night was wasted.** A queued run that could not
take the GPU skips its passes and finishes anyway — which used to look exactly
like a clean run from the bank list. Each card now carries the verdict of its
last 🚀 Launch all when there is one worth carrying: *"2 passes skipped"* or
*"1 step failed"*, with the reason on hover. A clean run shows **nothing** — a
tick on every card only makes the one card that needs attention harder to find.
The distinction is deliberate: a pass that declined itself for a stated
prerequisite (semantic de-dup wanting ✨ Score first) is the pipeline working as
designed and is not flagged; a pass the machine refused ("GPU busy", never
reached) is. When the queue empties, one line says how many finished and how
many had problems.

## Choosing where a bank pass runs

Every pass button in the bank ends in \`…\` and opens a **launch window** before
anything runs. The window is not a settings panel — it says three separate
things, and keeping them apart is the point.

**This run — where it applies, and how big that is.** Five lines, and each one
quotes the number of images *that pass* would actually walk:

| Line | What it means |
|---|---|
| Kept + undecided | What every pass has always run on. The default; picking it sends exactly the request the app sent before this window existed. |
| ✓ Kept only | The images you already decided to keep. |
| Undecided only | The ones you have not ruled on. |
| ✕ Unkept only (the bin) | Images you rejected. Nothing is deleted or un-rejected — but the run spends its time on shots you set aside, and the window says what that costs for this particular pass. |
| All three, the bin included | Everything. |

If you have images **selected**, that becomes the first line and wins by
default — the pass runs on your selection, narrowed by what it still has to do.
It says *"up to N"*, never a bare N, because the server intersects your selection
with the pass's own pool and the run can only ever be shorter.

Under those lines sits the **"do it again"** tick: *also re-measure images that
were already scanned*, *throw the cached embeddings away*, and so on. This is
where the old **Rescan all** and **Rescore all** buttons went. They were never
separate passes — they were this scope, wearing a button's clothes — so they now
sit next to the pool they re-run, unticked, with their price written next to
them.

**Settings this pass reads.** Only what the *calculation* consumes, with where
each value lives. 🔎 Scan quality, for instance, reads exactly one of the twelve
🎚 filter thresholds (\`dup_distance\`), and it reads it for the duplicate grouping
at the end — not for the measuring.

**Not decided here.** The knobs that only change how the grid is **sorted and
flagged**. Those re-apply the moment you save them, with no pass at all. The
sharpness, noise and aesthetic thresholds live here: nudging one costs you
nothing.

Three passes **refuse a partial scope**, and the window shows the option greyed
out with the reason rather than hiding it: **✨ Score**, **👥 Group by person**
and **✂ Find crops & variants** each produce one numbering of the *whole* bank,
recomputed from scratch on every run. Handed a slice, they would number that
slice from 1 and land those ids on top of unrelated groups already saved.

Two things the scope does **not** cover, stated in the windows that need it:
🔎 Scan's duplicate grouping always covers the whole bank (it works from stored
hashes and renumbers them together), and 🎨 Classify medium also runs chained
inside ✨ Score with the default scope.

A run with **nothing to do** is refused before it starts, with the reason and a
suggestion — not launched and then reported as a success.

**The two watermark cleaning levels take the same scope**, and they are the two
where it matters most: ✂ **Auto-crop** and 🧽 **Repaint** are the only actions on
this page that produce a new image file. Their windows list the same five lines,
with one difference — their pool is not a pile but *the flagged images carrying a
usable mark*, so a scope narrows that set and can never widen it. The count on
each line is the pool the level **walks**; ✂ then crops only the marks that sit
in a border band, which is the narrower number written on the button itself.
Both windows state what is reversible before you start: your own files are never
written to, the cleaned pixels live in the bank's own copy, and ↩ **Undo
cleaning** deletes those copies and re-flags the images. Undo is bank-wide rather
than per run, and two things are out of its reach — an image you already promoted
(that copy was written into the dataset) and an image whose source file changed
on disk since the clean.

## When a folder is already one person

Scraped material usually arrives sorted: one folder per person. **👤 Group by
person** does not know that, so it pays one face embedding per image to
rediscover what the folder name already said — thousands of inferences for an
answer you had before you started.

Scope the grid to a folder with the **Subfolder** picker and the panel under it
offers **👤 Single person here**. One click groups every image of that folder as
one person, instantly, with no pass at all — and the next 👤 Group by person run
**skips those images entirely**. That skip is the saving: on a bank of 9 000
images where 8 000 sit in asserted folders, the pass embeds 1 000.

It is a rule, not a stamp. It survives re-scans, and an image you drop into the
folder tomorrow joins the group the moment the bank sees it. It is also
reversible at any time — **↩ Not one person after all** dissolves the group and
puts the folder back in the way of normal clustering. Nothing is deleted either
way.

**Check a sample (15 images)** is the honest counterweight. It picks about
fifteen images spread across the whole folder (not the first fifteen — those are
usually one shoot), embeds *only those*, and compares them at the same
similarity threshold the clustering uses. You get either *sample consistent
(14/15 same person)* or *2 different faces in the sample — check this folder*.
Two limits, stated plainly: fifteen images cannot prove a folder is clean, only
that the sample looked one way; and whatever it finds, **your assertion stands**
until you revoke it. It informs, it never overrules you.

Images in the folder that the face machinery could not read — no face in frame,
a face too small or too turned — are listed as *worth a look*. They stay in the
group: "I could not see a face here" is not "this is someone else".

### The app asks the question for you

You should not have to guess which of your forty folders are worth declaring, so
the same sampling runs by itself and **suggests**. A folder it sampled and found
consistent gets a **👤?** next to its name in the Subfolder picker, and scoping
to it says *Looks like one person (15/15 of the 15 sampled) — assert?* next to
the button. A folder holding several people says so too, which is just as useful.

**It suggests. It never asserts.** Confirming is always the same single click it
always was. This is deliberate: a wrong assertion made silently would corrupt
your person grouping with something you never said, and you would have no reason
to go looking for it.

It runs in three places, and the difference is when you are asked:

- **as the preflight of 👤 Group by person** — the default path, described in the
  next section. You are asked at launch time, before the expensive pass runs.
- **automatically at the end of 👤 Group by person** — free. That pass has just
  cached an embedding for every image, so sampling every folder adds no
  inference at all and no GPU time. The pass's line then ends with *N folder(s)
  look like a single person*.
- **on demand, with 🔎 Scan folders** — a secondary path now, for asking well
  before you launch anything. This one pays about fifteen embeddings per folder,
  so it says how many folders it will cover before you click, and covers the
  twenty biggest first when there are more. It tells you what it did not reach
  rather than leaving you to assume the rest are not one person.

A suggestion expires when the folder changes. If images arrive or leave, the
verdict no longer describes what is in front of you, so it is dropped and the
folder goes back into the queue instead of advising you from stale evidence.

## Checking your folders before the person pass

Everything above used to be reachable only from the Subfolder panel — and the
first thing anyone does with a fresh bank is press **🚀 Launch all**, so they
never opened it and paid the full face pass over forty folders that each held
one person. A saving the default path walks past is not a saving.

So the sampling now runs **as the preamble of the pass itself**. Press **👥 Group
by person**, or **🚀 Launch all** with the person pass ticked, and before
anything expensive starts the bank samples about fifteen images in each
subfolder it has not been told about, then asks you once:

> **12 folders look like a single person** — treat each as one person and skip
> their full analysis.

Those twelve are **already ticked**. One click on **👤 Group 12 folders & analyze
the rest** confirms them and starts the pass you asked for; untick any you
disagree with; **👥 Analyze everything anyway** is right there and states its own
cost. It is still an offer, never a decision — a wrong grouping made silently is
one you would have no reason to go looking for.

Four things the dialog always tells you:

- **what the check costs, against what it saves** — *Checking 12 folders (~15
  images each — 180 in all, up to 720 where faces are hard to find), against the
  7 316 this pass would embed.*
- **what ticking the boxes spares** — *3 412 images are grouped instantly and
  skipped by the pass.*
- **why a folder is not offered** — *3 different faces in the sample — analyzed
  in full*. A doubtful folder is never quietly ticked.
- **what it did not reach.** The preflight covers up to 200 folders in one go.
  Beyond that it says *N folders were not checked (biggest first) — they get the
  full analysis*, because silence there would read as "the rest are not one
  person".

### When the sampled images have no face in them

Scraped folders are full of crops, backs, distant shots and blur. A sample of
fifteen can land entirely on those, and until recently that ended the folder's
story: *only 0 of 15 sampled images had a usable face — analyzed in full*. On a
3 546-image folder that meant fifteen embeddings spent for no answer at all, and
then the whole pass anyway — exactly the cost the check exists to avoid.

A draw that cannot be read is now **replaced**. The check keeps drawing new
images — never one it has already tried, still spread across the whole folder —
until it has about fifteen images with a usable face, or until it runs out of
**budget**. That budget is the point, because "keep drawing" without one is the
full pass by the back door. It is the smaller of two numbers, per folder:

- **at most 60 images** — fifteen usable faces at a hit rate of one in four,
  which is the worst rate still worth chasing;
- **at most a quarter of the folder** — so a small folder is never nearly
  analysed in full just to be described. Folders of 60 images or fewer keep the
  single draw they have always had.

That cap is also why the check can never quietly become expensive: a quarter of
a folder is a quarter of what analysing it would cost, and the dialog prints the
ceiling next to the typical cost before you start.

Three ways it can end, and each says which one it is:

- **enough usable faces** — the verdict you already know: *15/15 of 30 sampled
  images look like the same person.*
- **the budget ran out with a few** — *looks like one person, on thin evidence —
  only 6 usable faces in 60 images tried.* It is still offered and still
  pre-ticked, because the bar for an offer has always been two agreeing faces and
  six is more evidence than two, not less — but the row says what it rests on so
  you can weigh it.
- **almost nothing readable** — *no readable face in 60 images tried across the
  folder — crops, backs or blur.* This is not the check failing; it is what the
  folder is. **The full pass will not do better on those images**: the preflight,
  the folder check and the pass all drive the same detector at the same
  thresholds, and the check writes its answers into the pass's own embedding
  cache, so the pass reads them straight back rather than looking again. Grouping
  by face simply has little to grip in that folder, and much of it will stay
  ungrouped whatever you run.

If there is nothing to ask — a bank with no subfolders, or one whose folders you
have already declared — no dialog appears at all and the pass starts straight
away. And whatever you accept here is an **ordinary assertion**: it survives
re-scans, adopts images that land in the folder later, and **↩ Not one person
after all** undoes it exactly as if you had clicked it by hand.

While the check is running you can stop it with **👥 Analyze everything anyway**;
it lets the sampling go and launches the full pass.

## Pick a balanced set

Advice is only half the gesture, so **📊 Coverage advice** ends with **⚖️ Pick a
balanced set** (the same button sits in the **Curate** row). It answers a
question no per-image score can ask: *does my set cover what I want to be able to
generate?*

Ask **🎨 Pick diverse** for 20 images out of a bank that is 47% full body, 35%
bust, 12% face and 6% back views, and you get roughly those proportions — on a
synthetic reproduction of exactly that shape it returned **0 face shots and 0
back views**. The LoRA then renders one shot type well and the rest badly, and
nothing ever said so. **⚖️ Balanced pick** returns **5 face, 5 bust, 5 body, 5
back** out of the same pool, each bucket filled with the *same* most-varied
sampling — and the same **Skip the odd ones out** guard — that 🎨 Pick diverse
uses.

- **Balance on** — **Framing** by default. It is the axis that carries real
  information: on a one-subject bank, person groups are sparse and split into
  many small, arbitrary clusters, so balancing on them spreads a selection over
  noise. **Framing × person** is there for a dump that genuinely holds several
  subjects.
- **When an axis can't be satisfied**, it says so instead of quietly filling the
  gap: *"Only 3 back images exist in this filter — an even split wanted 15"*. The
  freed picks go to the buckets that have room, so asking for 60 still gives you
  60 — the deficit is reported as a number, never hidden. If even that isn't
  enough, it says how many you actually got and why.
- **The result is always stated** — *"Selected 60 of 60 requested, spread over
  framing: 15 face, 15 bust, 15 body, 15 back"* — as text, per bucket, next to
  what each bucket had available. There is no chart you have to read.
- **An unlabelled bank is the normal state**, not an error. Nothing has a framing
  until the 📐 Framing pass has run, so the button says which pass is missing and
  how many images it would bring in, rather than returning an empty or misleading
  selection. 🎨 Pick diverse keeps working without it.

Like the other selectors it honours the current filter and search, and it only
**selects** — nothing is kept, rejected or deleted.

## Is this image really what it says it is?

Two things a file will happily lie about, both measured by the ordinary
**🔎 Scan quality** pass — plain CPU work, no extra install, no GPU.

**Its size.** An image enlarged from 512 px to 2048 px still *reports* 2048, so
it walks into a dataset as a high-resolution shot and the LoRA learns
interpolated mush. The scan measures how far real detail actually goes and says
it in pixels on the image's details line: *"2048 px stored · ~512 px of real
detail"*. The worst offenders sit behind the **🧇 Soft detail** filter chip,
and *Settings → Captioning & quality → Real-detail minimum* moves the bar.

Treat it exactly like the sharpness score: **a shortlist, not a verdict.** A
photo with motion blur, a portrait with the background thrown out of focus, and
a heavily denoised phone shot all genuinely lack fine detail and all read the
same way as an enlargement — which is fine for choosing training images (a LoRA
learns as little from either), but it is not proof the image was ever resized.
Look before you mass-reject. Two honest limits: a *nearest-neighbour* enlargement
is invisible to it (blocky pixels are real high-frequency detail), and large
enlargements are under-stated, so the pixel figure ranks images rather than
recovering the original file's size.

**Where it came from.** The scan reads the file's own metadata and sorts the
bank with the **🔎 Origin** chips:

- **🤖 AI** — the file still carries generation metadata: a ComfyUI workflow
  in the PNG, A1111-style \`parameters\`, or the C2PA/XMP "generated" marker the
  commercial generators write. Certain when present.
- **📷 Camera** — the file still carries camera EXIF (make, model, exposure).
  Strong evidence it was actually photographed.
- **❔ Unknown** — nothing left to read. **This is the normal answer**, not a
  failure: scrapers, chat apps and social networks strip metadata on sight (on a
  36 000-image Telegram export, *every single file* landed here). It is not
  evidence the image is a real photo, and it is not evidence it is AI — it is
  the absence of evidence, which is why it is its own answer instead of being
  quietly folded into "not AI".

On an image whose metadata is gone, the details line may add a *hint* when the
dimensions are a standard generator size (1024×1024, 832×1216, 896×1152…) and
there is no camera EXIF. It says it is a hint; plenty of crops and downloads
land on round numbers too.

Two smaller facts come free with the same pass: **🎞 Black bars** flags flat
letterbox/pillarbox padding (video screenshots, stills padded into a square,
which survive a training crop), and the **JPEG quality** of the last save is
shown as-is — a low figure means the file has been through a re-encoding
pipeline, but it is far too common to be worth a filter.

A bank you already scanned picks all of this up on its next **🔎 Scan** — the
pass re-visits the images that predate these measurements on its own. You do not
need a full rescan.

## Sort a bank by medium and by head angle

Two more ways to slice a big dump, both built on passes you have already paid
for.

### 🎨 Medium — what the picture is *made of*

**🎨 Classify medium** sorts every scored image into **📷 Photo**, **🅰 Anime**,
**🧊 3D render**, **🖌 Illustration** — or **❔ Unsure**. It reads the CLIP
embedding the **✨ Score** pass already computed, so it looks at no image twice,
downloads nothing, and never touches the GPU. On a 23 000-image bank it finishes
in seconds. An image ✨ Score has not reached has no embedding and stays
unclassified; the row says how many.

**You no longer have to ask for it.** Because it costs nothing beyond what
✨ Score already paid, it now runs **automatically at the end of every ✨ Score
pass**, and the pass's own line reports it (\`· 🎨 Medium: 812 classified\`). If
the CLIP text encoder is missing, the line says *skipped* and names the reason
rather than staying quiet. The **🎨 Classify medium** button is still there: it
is how you re-run the pass on its own, and how you re-classify images that
already carry a verdict — something the automatic run never does, so a verdict
you are looking at is never rewritten behind your back.

This is **not** the same question as **🔎 Origin** above. Origin reads the
*file's metadata* and answers "who made this file". Medium reads *the picture*
and answers "what does it look like". A photorealistic AI portrait is 🤖 AI and
📷 Photo at the same time; a scanned manga page is ❔ Unknown and 🅰 Anime.
Neither is evidence for the other.

**What it is worth, measured.** On a real 23 532-image bank, against 167 images
labelled by hand:

- photograph verdicts were right **90 out of 90** times;
- both real anime drawings in the sample were found;
- every 3D render and illustration in the sample came back **Unsure**.

That last line is the honest shape of this feature. The bar for a non-photo
verdict is deliberately six times higher than for a photograph, because the
model reads a picture's *subject* as much as its medium: a photo of somebody
**cosplaying** an anime character scores as anime. At a lower bar the "anime"
pile filled with cosplay photographs and the "3D render" pile with advertising
banners. So the pass answers **Unsure** rather than guessing, and the row prints
how big that pile is instead of hiding it. Sort by **🎨 Medium confidence ↑** to
put the images it nearly could not call in front of you.

### ⤢ Angle — where the head is pointing

The **🎭 Person groups** pass estimates a head pose while it works. The **⤢**
chips turn that into **😐 Frontal** (turned less than 20°), **◑ Three-quarter**
(20–60°), **👤 Profile** (more than 60°) and **🔙 From behind**.

Two limits worth knowing before you trust a count:

- **Profile is under-counted.** A head turned far enough that one eye disappears
  often defeats the face detector outright, and an image with no detected face
  has no angle at all. The profiles you see are the ones that were still
  detectable.
- **From behind needs two passes.** It is the crossing of "no face found" with
  "the **📐 Framing** pass called it a back view" — because *no face* on its own
  is also what a landscape with nobody in it looks like. Without the framing
  pass this bucket stays empty rather than claiming a person is there.

**If your bank was scanned before this shipped**, its faces have no angle: older
builds measured the pose, used it once and threw it away, and the number is not
recoverable from what was stored. The ⤢ row then offers to measure them, tells
you how many there are and roughly how long it will take on your machine, and
does nothing until you click. It re-runs the face detector on those images only,
writes nothing but the angle, and leaves your person groups exactly as they are.

## Set the bank filters from a sentence

At the top of **Triage**, **🗣 Describe the set you want** takes a plain request —
\`an amateur photo set, least polished first\` — and moves the bank's own controls:
medium, quality flags, resolution tier, sort. The chip counters below then say,
measured, how many images that lands on.

The model never looks at your images and never chooses any. It reads the sentence
and nothing else, so a wrong reading costs you one glance at chips you can edit,
not a silent selection you would have to trust. Everything it proposes lands in the
same filters a click would set, and clearing them is the same gesture as always.

It answers over what your bank has actually measured. The real per-value counts go
to the model with the request, so it cannot reach for a bucket that holds nothing.

**It says when it cannot.** Asking for what is *in* the pictures — \`women
outdoors\` — has nowhere to land while captions cover a small fraction of a bank
and framing almost none of it. That part of the request comes back as *not
expressible here* rather than as a filter that would return a few thousand
convincing, unrelated images.

**It will not turn an exclusion into a search.** The ranker returns *more* of a
negated thing, not less (\`a woman without a bikini\` measured 60% bikinis against a
10.1% baseline), so \`without a watermark\` is reported back to you instead of being
quietly sent. To guarantee an absence, use the word-exclude box.

## Choose CLIP or SigLIP 2 for Bank semantics

Each Bank has its own **Semantic engine** choice in **① Analyze**:

- **CLIP** is the compatible default. Its index is the embedding cache already
  produced by **✨ Score**, so every existing Bank behaves exactly as before.
- **SigLIP 2** is optional. Install the pinned model once in **Setup ▸ Quality
  tools**, select it on the Bank, then explicitly build that Bank's semantic
  index. Selecting it never starts a scan or downloads a model by itself.

The selected engine powers **Find by text**, **Similar to selected**, **Pick
diverse**, **Balanced pick**, visual spread/coverage and **Find crops &
variants**. The calibrated aesthetic head, NSFW score, visual-style groups and
**🎨 Medium** remain on CLIP regardless of this choice.

CLIP and SigLIP 2 use separate, model-versioned caches and separate **same-shot
group partitions**. Switching swaps the visible partition but keeps both, so
returning to an engine restores its grouping instead of erasing completed work.
Both partitions and their exact cache entries travel with the existing analysis
snapshot on Bank → Dataset, Dataset → Bank and Bank → Bank copies; a changed
image fails the fingerprint check and is re-indexed instead of receiving stale
analysis.

The SigLIP 2 index is resumable and stoppable like Score: completed entries are
written atomically, and a later launch pays only for missing, failed or changed
images. **Reindex SigLIP 2** rebuilds that cache only; it never touches Score.

## Find bank images by describing them

Under **Curate**, **🔤 Find by text** ranks images by how close they are to a
phrase you type — \`brunette outdoors, wide shot\`, \`red dress against a white
wall\`, \`close-up, harsh flash\`. It reads the Bank's selected semantic index:
the existing **✨ Score** cache for CLIP, or the separate index you explicitly
built for SigLIP 2. A search itself performs no image inference; searching while
a LoRA trains is fine.

**It is a ranking, not a filter.** Every image scores *something* against every
phrase, so a result list always comes back full. The panel therefore reports the
similarity of the best and of the last result, and tells you how far apart they
are — *"all about equally close"*, *"the last ones are noticeably looser"*, or
*"the tail is much weaker than the top"*. That spread is the useful signal: it
says whether you can trust the bottom of the list.

**Do not read those numbers as percentages, and do not compare engines by their
raw values.** The following measurements are specifically for the default CLIP
ViT-L/14 \`openai\` space, on a real bank (48 images from 8 unrelated datasets):

| | Range |
|---|---|
| Top-1 results verified correct by eye | **0.177 – 0.233** |
| Guaranteed-unrelated image/phrase pairs | median **0.112**, up to **0.197** |

So 0.22 is not "22% of a match" — it is roughly as good as this model ever gets.

**And this is why there is no similarity slider.** Look at the two rows again:
the unrelated *ceiling* (0.197) is **higher** than two genuinely correct answers
(0.177 and 0.178). The distributions overlap, so no cut-off separates "relevant"
from "unrelated" — anything below ~0.20 lets false positives through, anything
above ~0.18 throws away true matches. A threshold control would be a knob on a
boundary that does not exist, so the app gives you a result *count* instead and
shows the ranking honestly.

The app never compares your scores against those figures either. It measures
what a *typical* image of **your** bank scores for **your** phrase, and describes
the results relative to that — which is the only version of the question that
survives a different bank.

**On a bank that is mostly one subject** — the normal case here — expect the
ranking to flatten. Images of the same person score 0.60–0.89 against *each
other*, far above any text score, and a query's ability to discriminate
compresses by 30–70%. The summary will say *"barely above what any image here
scores — the order is a hint at best"* when that happens. Believe it: at that
point the first result is not meaningfully better than the tenth.

It searches **inside the current filter**, exactly like Pick diverse and
Similar to selected. So "wide shots, in this subfolder, among the undecided" is
just a filter plus a phrase; nothing needs a second search grammar. Results land
as a normal selection you review with ✓ Keep / ✕ Reject / ⬆ Promote — nothing is
kept or deleted for you. **Clear search** returns to the full grid.

**Images missing from the selected index cannot be found by any phrase.** Rather
than letting them vanish, the summary counts them. Run **✨ Score** for CLIP, or
complete the explicit **SigLIP 2 index**, to include them.

### What it is good at, and what it is not

The default CLIP engine reads a picture as a whole. It is reliable for **subjects, styles, framing,
setting, materials and colour**, and unreliable for three things in particular:

| Ask for | What you actually get | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| **Counting** — "two people" | Photos of people, any number. | On a two-person image, "two people" beat "one person" by **0.001** — pure noise. It separates "one" from "several" at best. |
| **Negation** — "without glasses" | *More* glasses, not fewer. | On a photo of an astronaut **wearing** a helmet: "with a helmet" **0.212**, "without a helmet" **0.217**, plain "an astronaut" **0.219**. The negation scored **higher** than the affirmation. |
| **Spatial relations** — "to the left of" | Both objects, in any arrangement. | — |

The negation case is the one to remember, because it fails *silently and
backwards*: CLIP does not penalise "without", it simply ignores the word. Someone
searching \`woman without glasses\` gets women **wearing** glasses and has no way
to tell the search misfired. The same measurement on a 7,316-image bank: \`a
photo of a woman without a bikini\` returned **60% bikinis**, against a 10%
base rate — the query did not miss, it inverted. See **Push down** below.

These are properties of the model, not bugs to report. Describe what *is* in the
frame rather than what is absent, check counting and left/right by eye — and for
the negation case, use the **Push down** field described next, because typing
"without" will never work.

### Push down what you do not want

The panel has a second field, **Push down**, for the trait you are trying to get
away from: \`hat\`, \`sunglasses\`, \`blonde hair\`. You can also write it inline in
the query with a leading dash — \`a woman in a car -hat\` means the same thing.
Typing a query that starts negating something ("a woman without a hat") offers
you the field instead, rather than letting the search fail quietly.

It does **not** filter. The excluded phrase is encoded exactly like the positive
one and *subtracted* from each image's score, so images carrying that trait sink
in the ranking. They are still in the pool and one can still surface if it is
otherwise the best answer. If you need a guaranteed absence, that is a tag
filter's job, not this one.

**How hard** offers Gentle / Normal / Strong. The default, Normal, was measured
over 7,316 real bank images that carry both a CLIP embedding and a written
description, across 19 query/exclusion pairs, counting the top 60:

| How hard | Top 60 still carrying the unwanted trait | Top 60 still on-topic |
|---|---|---|
| off | 23.0% | 89.7% |
| Gentle | 11.9% | 89.5% |
| **Normal** | **7.6%** | **87.7%** |
| Strong | 3.8% | 79.8% |

Pushing harder always removes more of the trait — what you pay for it is
relevance, and that stays essentially flat up to Normal (2 points) then drops
off a cliff (10 points at Strong, 25 past it). That is why Normal is the default
and why Strong is described as a trade rather than as "better".

**Some pairs cannot be separated at all,** and the app says so instead of
pretending. Excluding \`a bikini\` from \`a woman at the beach\` barely moved: at
every usable strength two thirds of the results still had a bikini, because in
this model's eyes a beach photo largely *is* a bikini photo — and by the strength
that finally bit, the beach was gone too. After each search the summary reports
what actually happened on *your* bank: how many results the push-down brought in
that would not have been there, and how strongly the returned set still matches
the unwanted phrase compared with a typical image of the bank. When it changed
nothing, it says that too.

One last caveat, seen in the same measurement: a result can be right on the broad
trait and wrong on the detail. A generic indoor query returned a genuinely indoor
shot that was not the *kind* of indoor scene the wording implied. Text search
brings the likeliest images to the front; the final call stays yours.

### Why the first search takes a moment

The text encoder is the other half of the selected image/text model. Loading the
default CLIP encoder costs about **ten seconds** on the CPU; SigLIP 2 also has a
one-time model load. The app keeps the chosen encoder warm after the first
search, then releases it when you close the panel or after the idle window.
Every phrase is cached under that engine's model key, so CLIP and SigLIP 2 text
vectors can never be mixed and re-typing one is free even after a restart.

On a memory-tight machine you can set \`bank_scoring.text_search_idle_minutes\` to
\`0\`: nothing is ever kept warm, and each new phrase pays the ten seconds instead.

## Choose who captions a bank, and which pile

The 🏷️ **Caption** pass in ① Analyze has its own **Caption options** row, and
every control on it applies to **that run only** — your Settings stay the
default and are never rewritten from here.

**Which pile gets captioned.** Three choices, and rejected images are in none of
them:

- **Kept + undecided** — the default, and exactly what the pass always did.
- **✓ Kept only** — caption what you have already chosen, and nothing else. This
  is the cheap one: on a 20 000-image dump where you kept 300, it is 300 vision
  calls instead of 20 000.
- **Undecided only** — the opposite errand. Captions feed the 🔍 search and the
  🏷️ tag chips, so captioning the undecided pile is how you get *tools* to
  triage it with.

Each option carries its own count, and the button quotes the number it is really
about to write. That number is **not** the size of the pile: images that already
have a caption are skipped, so a bank of 4 000 kept images can honestly offer
"Caption 12 kept". When everything in a pile already has a caption the button
says so and goes inert.

**A selection wins.** Select images first and the scope select greys out: the
pass captions your selection, and the button switches to counting it. The server
would otherwise *intersect* the two, and "Caption 12 selected" could quietly
write 4.

**Which engine, and which model.** Two more selects on the same row:

- **Caption engine** — *Auto* is a chain, not a coin flip: JoyCaption drafts and
  Ollama covers whatever it missed. Forcing *JoyCaption only* removes the Ollama
  half rather than picking one of two.
- **Caption vision model** — any Ollama model you have pulled. It is only used
  when the engine can reach Ollama, and it is greyed out otherwise. A model
  configured elsewhere stays selectable even if it is not in the live list.

This last one matters more than it looks. A captioner that describes plainly
visible things in evasive terms produces captions that are about something
slightly *other* than your images — and a LoRA trained on those learns to look
away too, with nothing in the output to reveal it. The captions read perfectly
well. That is the problem. If you caption NSFW material, pair the **Explicit**
register with an uncensored (abliterated) model; the app warns you when the
model it is about to use does not look like one.

You can change the model between runs on the same bank. 🏷️ **Caption** never
rewrites anything: it only fills images that have no caption yet, so a second run
with a different model captions the rest, not the ones already done. To redo the
ones already done, see the next section.

## Redo the captions of a bank with a different model

🏷️ **Caption** skips images that already have a caption — which is what you want
until the day it isn't. Once a bank is fully captioned that button reaches zero
images and goes inert, and on a bank you captioned with a model you have since
decided was a poor one, "nothing left to caption" is the wrong answer.

🔄 **Re-caption**, at the end of the **Caption options** row, is that answer. It
runs the same pass with the same engine, model, register and length you picked on
that row, on the pile the scope select names — and it **overwrites** the captions
that are already there.

**It keeps the captions you wrote yourself.** Every caption now records who wrote
it — JoyCaption, Ollama, or you. "You" means: typed or corrected in a dataset's
caption box, changed by a find/replace across a dataset, or brought back as \`.txt\`
sidecars from another tool. That record travels with the text through
**Import to bank**, bank-to-bank copies, promotion back to a dataset, and backup
restores, so a caption you wrote in a dataset three steps ago is still recognised
as yours here. Re-caption skips those rows, exactly as the person pass skips a
subfolder you declared to hold one person.

**It tells you three numbers before you click, and never merges two of them.**
The button quotes what it will rewrite (the pile, minus what it spares). The amber
line under the row breaks the rest apart: how many captions it *keeps* because you
wrote them, how many it overwrites **whose author was never recorded**, and how
many a model wrote. The confirmation repeats them. None is an estimate; they all
come from the same count the pass itself uses, so the figure on the button is the
number of images that change.

**"Origin never recorded" is the one to read carefully.** Captions written before
the app started keeping track carry no author, and there is no way to work one out
after the fact. Those are re-captioned — sparing them would make this button do
nothing at all on any bank that already exists — so if you hand-wrote captions in
an older version, they are in that count. It is stated separately from the
machine-written ones for exactly that reason.

**If you do want your own captions redone**, tick **"Also rewrite the N caption(s)
I wrote"** next to the button. It only appears when there is something to protect,
it is never pre-ticked, and the confirmation names it again.

**There is still no undo.** The bank's ↩ Undo covers keep/reject decisions only;
it has never covered captions, and this change does not add one.

**It works by pile, never on a selection.** With images selected the button goes
inert and says why: a selection can cover pages that were never loaded, so the
app cannot count how many of them already have a caption — and it will not run a
destructive pass on a number it cannot state. Clear the selection to re-caption a
pile. 🏷️ **Caption** still honours selections as it always did.

## Review a bank one image at a time

Filter chips and bulk actions clear the obvious trash, but the last call —
*is this shot good enough for the LoRA?* — is made one image at a time, and
squinting at a 140-pixel thumbnail is not how you make it. **▶ Review** (above
the grid) opens the images of the **current filter** full size, one
after the other:

- **✓ Keep**, **✕ Reject**, **⏭ Skip** — each one saves and jumps straight to the
  next image. The keyboard is the point: **K** keep, **R** reject, **S** skip,
  **←/→** move without deciding, **Esc** to leave. A few hundred images go by in
  minutes.
- **⏭ Skip** decides nothing (the image stays undecided) but is not shown again
  in that run — it's "not now", not "no".
- **🎲 Random order** walks what's left in shuffled order instead of folder
  order. On a scraped dump of 3 000 photos, sequential order means 200
  near-identical frames in a row; random gives you a representative sample from
  the first click. Ticking or unticking it mid-run only re-orders what you have
  **not** seen yet — nothing you already judged comes back.
- Under the image, the facts the passes already computed (resolution, sharpness,
  aesthetic score, NSFW, quality flags, person and duplicate groups) so you can
  call it without leaving the lightbox.
- The counter is honest — *12 / 340* over the snapshot taken when you opened the
  review, so a decision that drops the image out of the filter can't make the
  run skip images or loop. Each decision is saved on the spot: close after fifty
  of them and all fifty are there.

The ▶ button on a tile starts the same review **at that image**. A plain click
on a tile still selects it for the bulk ✓/✕/⬆ bar, so both ways of working stay.

## Promote a shortlist out of a bank

**⬆ Promote** has three destinations, and picking the right one saves you a mess.

- **📁 An existing dataset** — the end of the funnel. The images are normalized
  to webp, deduplicated against what the dataset already holds, and become
  training material.
- **🆕 A new dataset** — the same door, for a dataset that does not exist yet.
  Give it a name and a trigger word and it is created on the spot, then filled.
  It is a **character** dataset with the usual defaults; concept or style, the
  target model and the fidelity all live in the dataset's own settings
  afterwards, so nothing is locked in by creating it here. If the trigger word
  is already used by another dataset you are told, but not stopped — two
  datasets may share one, and the app only refuses when both would train on the
  same base model. It is worth knowing early: that refusal arrives when you
  queue training, and renaming a trigger by then also renames its deployed LoRA
  and run folder.
- **🗃 A new image bank** — for when you are not there yet. A 9 000-image dump,
  200 candidates isolated out of it, and you want to keep working on those 200
  apart: give the new bank a name and the selection lands in it, **un-triaged**,
  with every bank tool available again (scan, dedup, framing, captions, review).
  Nothing is committed to training.

With images selected in the grid, those are the ones that go; with nothing
selected, every **kept** image does.

Whichever door you pick, the promotion runs as a background job **on the bank**,
so the progress bar stays on the page you clicked from — and if the bank turns
out to be busy with another pass, nothing is created at all: a dataset or bank
that was about to receive the copies is discarded rather than left behind empty.

Either way this is a **copy**. Banks never share their files, deliberately: the
app rewrites images in place (a re-crop, a watermark clean), so two banks reading
one file would stop being two banks at the first edit. The dialog therefore
states, before you click, **how many megabytes** the copy costs — a measured
figure for that exact selection, not an average. For photographs it is usually a
footnote; the line is there for the day a bank holds something heavier.

Your source bank is untouched by all this. It keeps every image, now marked ⬆
promoted, and your original folder is never written to — the copies live in the
app's own data folder, and deleting the new bank takes them with it.

If the copy cannot be written — a full disk, a drive pulled out — the new bank is
**discarded** rather than left holding half the shortlist and looking finished.
You are told what happened and nothing has changed.
## Undo the last bulk decision

A bank lets you mark hundreds of images with one click: select the whole filter
and press ✕, apply an auto-reject at a threshold, collapse every duplicate group,
or run 🚀 Launch all. That is the point of a bank — and it is also the click you
most want back when the threshold was wrong or the filter was not the one you
thought.

After any of those, an **↩ Undo** bar appears above the grid saying what
happened and how many images it moved. Press it and every one of those images
goes back to exactly what it was: its previous ✓/✕/undecided state *and* the
reason it carried. Images the action never touched are not touched here either —
if you had already kept a photo by hand and the bulk reject flipped it, undo puts
it back to **kept**, not to undecided.

The bar does not disappear on a timer, and it survives a page reload: the
decision it takes back lives in the app's database, not in your browser tab. It
stays until you use it, dismiss it, or run another bulk action.

**Its limits, stated plainly.**

- **One step.** Only the most recent bulk action is remembered. Run a second one
  and it replaces the first — this is a net under the click you just made, not a
  history of your session.
- **Until the app restarts.** The memory is in the running app. Restart it and
  the offer is gone; the decisions themselves are safely saved, as always.
- **It never over-claims.** If some of the images have left the bank since (a
  re-scan noticed the files were gone), or if you changed some of them yourself
  in the meantime — in ▶ Review, or in another tab — those are *not* overwritten.
  The result tells you exactly how many it restored out of how many, how many
  are gone, and names the ones a newer decision now owns.

**What is deliberately NOT offered.** Two bank actions have no undo, because a
half-working one would be worse than none:

- **🗑 Delete rejected** sends your source files to the recycle bin and drops
  their rows with everything the passes had computed about them. Files in the
  recycle bin are yours to restore, from your file manager — the app cannot do
  it for you, and it will not pretend otherwise. This action also withdraws any
  pending ↩ offer, since the images it pointed at are the ones just removed.
- **⬆ Promote** copies images into a dataset (or a new bank) through the normal
  import path. Un-promoting would mean deleting images in a dataset you may have
  already captioned, cropped or trained on. Delete them there if you want them
  gone.

The 🔄 rotate button needs no undo entry: turn the other way and the image is
byte-for-byte the original again.

## See why each image was rejected

Pick **✕ Rejected** and a second row of chips appears under it — **✕ Why** —
with one chip per reason and its count: ≈ Duplicate, ✂ Same shot, ✋ By hand,
Blurry, ⬜ Flat, 🔞 NSFW, and so on. Click one and the grid shows only that pile.

This is what you want before **🗑 Delete rejected**: that action is the one with
no undo, so being able to look at exactly what a pass took — and nothing else —
is the last check before the files go to the recycle bin.

**Where this matters most: duplicates.** Auto-reject and "Resolve ALL — keep
best" both close every duplicate group in one click. After that the **≈
Duplicates** chip reads **0**, and it is right to: it counts groups that are
still waiting on a decision from you, and there are none left. But the images it
just rejected are still in the bank, and until this row existed nothing could
select them. If you have ever auto-rejected duplicates and then wondered where
they went, ✕ Rejected → ✕ Why → **≈ Duplicate** is the answer. Crops and
variants found by the ✂ pass are under **✂ Same shot**, which goes quiet on
resolution for the same reason.

**Its limits, stated plainly.**

- **This selects, it never repairs.** These chips are a filter. Nothing here
  un-rejects an image or changes which copy of a duplicate group was kept. To
  put something back, select it and press ✓ Keep like anywhere else in the grid.
- **❔ Not recorded is a real answer, not an error.** Images rejected by an older
  build — before the app wrote down why — land here. Nothing is wrong with them
  beyond the decision itself; the chip exists so that pile is reachable instead
  of invisible. On a bank you triaged a long time ago it may hold everything.
- **The counts follow your other filters**, like every chip row: with a
  subfolder or a search active, ≈ Duplicate shows how many are in *that* view,
  not in the whole bank.
- **A reason is not a re-check.** It says what the app decided at the time, at
  the thresholds in force then. Re-tuning 🎚 thresholds does not rewrite it.

## Find more images like this one — by attribute, not by look

**Select an image** in a captioned bank and its tags are already there: beside
the gallery on desktop, or in the filter bar on a phone. Tick \`woman\`, \`red\`,
\`dress\` or \`balcony\` and the grid narrows to the images whose captions mention
them. No extra click, no badge to find.

**Select several and the row counts.** Each chip carries how many of your
selected images cite it — \`red dress 7 / 12\` means 7 of the 12 captioned images
you picked mention it. That is deliberately *not* an intersection: keeping only
the tags every single image shares would print 12 next to each survivor (a number
that says nothing) and usually leave you with one word. What you want to know is
that a tag describes over half of what you selected.

The row is honest about what it did **not** count, on its own lines:

- images in your selection with **no caption yet** — named, not folded into the
  denominator, so \`7 / 12\` always means 7 of 12 images that had something to say;
- images whose caption held **no word worth filtering on** (\`a photo of her\`) —
  a different problem with a different fix;
- a selection **too large to read in one request**, which says how many images it
  left out rather than quietly shrinking the total.

Tick a chip and the row **holds still** while the filter runs, even though
filtering clears the selection — it keeps showing the tags of the selection you
filtered *from*.

The 🏷️ **badge on a tile** is still there, in the bottom-right corner next to ▶
and ⛶ where the tile's actions live. It reads one image's tags *without*
selecting it. On an image with no caption — or a caption with no word worth
filtering on — the badge stays visible and greyed, and its tooltip says which of
the two it is: a feature that silently disappears is indistinguishable from one
that was never built.

This is the readable cousin of **🎯 Similar to selected**, and the difference is
worth knowing because they fail differently:

| | 🎯 Similar to selected | 🏷️ Tags of this image |
|---|---|---|
| Matches on | the whole look (the selected CLIP or SigLIP 2 index) | words *you* ticked |
| Works without captions | yes | no |
| Tells you *why* it matched | no | yes — the chips you ticked |

Details that decide what you get:

- **Several chips mean AND.** Ticking \`red\` and \`dress\` shows images mentioning
  both, so every extra chip narrows further. The line under the chips says so
  while the filter is active.
- **Chips are matched as whole words**, in captions *and* file names. \`car\` will
  not bring back \`scarf\`. (The 🚫 exclude box below is looser — it matches
  anywhere — because a word you type by hand is often a fragment on purpose.)
- **Booru captions keep their tags whole** (\`red dress\` stays one chip); prose
  captions are cut into words, so \`golden hour\` becomes two chips and ticking
  both means "captions with both words", not "captions about golden hour".
- **It only sees what a captioner wrote.** An attribute nobody put in words is
  invisible here, however plain it is in the picture. Caption more of the bank
  (🏷️ Caption all) and the chips get better.
- It composes with every other filter, and it travels with them — **Select all**,
  **▶ Review** and the curation picks all work on what you can see.

## Hide images you have already handled

The bank's 🔍 search box narrows the grid *to* a word. Next to it, the 🚫
**Exclude words** box does the opposite: it hides every image whose **caption or
file name** contains what you type. That turns a captioned bank into a checklist
— *what have I not tagged yet?* — instead of a list you have to keep re-reading.

- **Several words at once**, comma-separated: \`logo, watermark, screenshot\` hides
  anything mentioning any of them.
- **It composes with everything else** — the search box included. Searching
  \`dress\` while excluding \`red\` gives you the dresses that are not red, and the
  filter chips, subfolder, resolution tier and framing all still apply.
- **It travels with the filter**: **Select all**, **▶ Review** and the
  curation picks (🎨 diverse, ⚖️ balanced, similar) all work on the
  visible set, so an image you hid is never handed back to you by a pick.

Two limits worth knowing:

- **It matches anywhere in the text**, like the search box — so \`car\` also hides
  \`scarf\`. Type the longer word when that matters.
- **Images with no caption are never hidden.** They have nothing to match, and
  hiding them would remove exactly the images a checklist is looking for.

Unlike the sort, the exclude box is **not remembered** between visits: an order
you can see in a menu is a habit, but images missing from a grid for a reason you
set last week reads as data loss.

## Filter a bank on a small screen

The bank's filter panel — the search boxes, every chip row, the 🔖 tag facets and
the 🎚 thresholds — is a lot of controls on a phone: roughly fifteen wrapped rows
before the first thumbnail. It now opens **folded** on a small screen (and
**expanded** on a desktop), behind one line that names every filter currently
narrowing the grid, e.g. *"✓ Kept · 🌫 Blurry · 1–2 MP +2 more"*. Tap the header to
open or close it — the choice is remembered for next time, across every bank.

A folded panel never hides *what* it is doing: the summary line is built from
the same list of active facets as the "N shown of M" count above the grid, so
the two can never disagree, and the full list is always available in the
header's tooltip. **✕ Clear all** appears next to it whenever something is
active, and turns every filter off in one tap — search, exclude, status,
quality/score/group flags, resolution, origin, framing and both kinds of tag
filter. It leaves the **sort order** alone: a ranking is not a filter, and
resetting it on every "start over" would be a second, unrelated surprise.

Selecting thumbnails and deciding on them used to mean opposite ends of the
page — tap tiles at the bottom, then scroll all the way back up past the filter
panel to reach ✓ Keep / ✕ Reject. Those buttons — plus Skip (back to
undecided), the two rotate buttons and CLR (clear the ticks) — now live in a
bar **pinned to the bottom of the screen** the moment anything is selected.
Keep and Reject share one even row; Skip and CLR share the next. It takes up real space at the end of
the page rather than floating over it: the page grows to make room for it, so
scrolling all the way down still shows you the last row of thumbnails and the
pagination controls with nothing hidden behind the bar. The ↩ Undo offer after
a bulk decision appears in the same bar, right where the buttons that made the
decision are.

## Sort a grid to review faster

Filters answer *which images*; sorting answers *which one first*. Both grids
have a **Sort** control, and it changes nothing but the order — the same images
match, the counts stay put, and every bulk action keeps operating on exactly
what the filters left.

In a **bank** (View ▸ Sort, next to the tile size) you can order by *anything the
passes measured*, either way. The menu is grouped by the pass that produces the
figure, so a greyed-out section also tells you which pass to run:

- **📁 File** — **Resolution ↓ / ↑** (megapixels, so a 900×900 outranks a wider
  1200×300) and **File size ↓ / ↑** (bytes on disk — the one figure no filter
  chip exposes).
- **✨ Score** — **Aesthetic ↓ / ↑** (the 1–10 rating; ↓ puts your keepers on the
  first page, ↑ puts the duds there, which is usually the faster way to prune)
  and **NSFW likelihood ↓ / ↑**.
- **🔎 Scan quality** — **Sharpness** (↑ brings the blurry misses to you),
  **Noise**, **Contrast** (↑ = the flattest, near-empty frames first), **Detail**
  (↑ = the enlargements pretending to be big images), **Letterbox bars** and
  **JPEG quality**.
- **🎭 Faces** — **Face confidence ↓ / ↑**, the detection score: ↑ surfaces the
  tiny, turned or half-hidden faces.

A chip and a sort answer different questions. A chip only ranks the images that
*cross* its threshold, so "the noisiest of the ones I am keeping" — all of them
below the threshold — is a question only the sort can answer, and no chip ranks
the other way round at all.

**The bank remembers the order you chose, per bank.** Reopen it tomorrow and it
opens the way you were reviewing it; other banks keep their own. Pick **Default**
to forget the preference.

In a **dataset** (above the grid, next to the decision chips) there are two
kinds of entry, and they answer different questions:

- **Face similarity ↓ / ↑** — the ArcFace cosine against your reference photo
  computed by **🎭 Analyze faces**. ↓ is "who looks most like my subject", ↑ is
  the shortlist to cut. This *ranks* the whole grid.
- **Shot type** — face, then bust, then body, then back, in the order the
  composition bar counts them. This *groups*: it ranks nothing, it puts every
  shot of one kind in a single run so you can compare like with like. A grid in
  arrival order interleaves the four kinds, which is the wrong arrangement for
  the question you are actually asking — *do I have too many of these, not
  enough of those, and which of these near-identical ones do I keep?* The shot
  type is the one the **📐 Classify framing** pass wrote (and the one the shot
  card carried, for a generated image).
- **Shot type, then face similarity ↓** — the same grouping, with the closest to
  your reference at the head of each kind. This is the order for curating: walk
  down a run and the ones to cut are at its end.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Images a pass never reached always go last**, in both directions. An
  un-analysed image has no score — putting it first would bury the very images
  you asked to see.
- **A sort you have no data for is greyed out** and says which pass to run,
  rather than pretending to reorder. Run the pass, and it lights up.

In a bank the ordering is done by the database over the *whole* filter, not just
the page you can see — so **Select all** and **▶ Review** walk the same
order you are looking at.

## Move through a dataset without closing the image

Open any dataset image full screen (the 🔍 on its tile) and you can walk the
whole grid from there: **⟨** and **⟩** on the left and right edges of the picture,
or the **←** and **→** keys. **Esc** closes, as before.

The badge next to the image's name — **12 / 340** — is the part worth reading. It
counts *the images the grid is showing you*, so:

- **The arrows follow your filters and your sort.** Chip the grid down to "34
  awaiting ✓/✕", sort by face similarity, and ⟩ walks those 34 in that order.
  Change a filter and the badge changes with it. They never step onto an image
  the grid is currently hiding — if they did, you would have no way to notice.
- **They cross pages.** A dataset over 500 images is paged, and ⟩ turns the page
  under the overlay: close the lightbox and you are on the page holding the
  image you were just looking at, not where you started.
- **They stop at the ends.** There is no wrap-around: on the first image ⟨ goes
  grey and says *"You are on the first of the 340 images shown here"*, and the
  same at the other end. On a wall of near-identical shots, a loop that silently
  restarts makes "have I seen everything?" unanswerable.

What does **not** travel with you: the 100 % zoom, an open **⧉ Compare with
original** pane, and an improvement running on the image you left. Each image is
inspected from a clean slate — a pane captioned *original* is always the parent
of the picture in front of you, never of the previous one.

Navigating is a *read*, so it keeps working while a generation, a captioning
pass or a watermark scan holds the dataset — the same rule as opening an image
and ticking a selection. Only the edits in the bar (crop, mirror, rotate,
improve) wait for the pass.

The rescue pairs in **Curation** are the one place with no arrows: there you are
judging one pair, not walking a list.

## Keep or reject a dataset image without leaving the picture

The full-screen view is where you can actually *see* whether a hand is right or
an eye is mush — so that is where the verdict belongs. The bar under the image
carries the same three buttons as the Bank's **▶ Review**, on the same keys:

- **✓ Keep** — \`K\`
- **✕ Reject** — \`R\`
- **⏭ Skip** — \`S\` (or **→**)

**Keep and Reject move you on** as soon as the verdict is saved, so a folder of
300 pictures is worked through with one hand on the keyboard and never a return
trip to the grid. **Skip is nothing but "next"**: the image keeps whatever it
already had, undecided included. **←** goes back the same way — navigation only,
it decides nothing.

It is the *same* verdict as the ✓ / ✕ on the tile behind the overlay, not a
second one: only kept images are captioned, exported and trained on, and the
grid, the counters and the ⬇ Export all read that one status. The chip beside
the image's name says which one it is carrying right now — **✓ kept**,
**✕ rejected** or **· undecided** — so you can tell a landed decision from a
missed keystroke.

Two things it deliberately does not do. **Nothing is deleted**: a reject is a
status, the file stays on disk and ✓ takes it back. And **the verdict is sent
before you move** — on a slow disk the buttons grey out for a moment rather than
walking on with a decision still in flight.

At the end of the list there is nowhere to advance to, so the picture stays in
front of you wearing its new chip; the ⟩ arrow already says which end that is.

## Inspect an image on a phone

Below a phone-sized window the lightbox changes shape, and it is the same
picture, the same actions and the same keys — only their arrangement moves.

- **The image takes the screen.** In a side-by-side comparison, both panes do.
- **Every action moves behind one button**, the **☰ Actions** pill floating at
  the bottom of the picture: compare with the original, compare with the
  reference, crop, mirror, rotate left and right, improve, upscale, the Klein
  instruction with its editor and its model, and the links to Settings. Nothing
  is dropped and nothing is renamed — it is the same list, in the same order,
  in a panel instead of a strip.
- **The panel is a drawer, not a new screen.** It covers the bottom of the
  picture and leaves the top of it visible, so you can see what you are about to
  rotate. **Esc** peels one layer: it closes the panel first, and the lightbox
  only once the panel is closed. **Done** and the pill itself close it too.
- **Asking to compare closes the drawer**, because a comparison is a request to
  *look* at something. The edits (rotate, mirror, improve) leave it open — those
  get chained.
- **⟨ / ⟩ and the ← → keys still walk the grid**, and moving to another image
  closes the panel with the picture it belonged to.

Why it changed: at 400 px the old bar was not a bar. Crop, Mirror, two Rotates,
two Improve buttons and the Klein note each took a full-width row, and with the
Klein instruction editor unfolded the photo itself was left **96 px tall** —
about 11 % of the screen. Side-by-side comparison, where size is the entire
point, gave each pane **144 px**. Measured again after the change, on the same
screen: **538 px** for a single image whatever the editor is doing, and **354 px
per pane** in comparison.

On a desktop none of this applies: the actions stay in the bottom bar, or in the
side rail beside a portrait photo, which already spends width the image cannot
use.

## Compare an improved image with the original

Two things in the app never overwrite an image — they add a **candidate** next
to it, and leave the choice to you:

- **✨ Upscale & improve** in the dataset lightbox (a manual Klein pass, 2 MP by
  default);
- the automatic **small-image rescue** of scraped images under 768 px.

Open that candidate full screen and it now carries **⧉ Compare with original**.
The view splits in two named panes — *Original* and *Improved* (or *Klein
rescue*) — **side by side on a wide screen, stacked on a phone**, where width is
the scarce axis and two half-width thumbnails would prove nothing.

Both panes are the same size and both images are fitted inside them, so they are
shown at **the same scale and the same framing** even though the candidate has
more pixels. That matters: an improve pass rescales to a megapixel budget, and
two images displayed at different scales cannot be compared honestly.

**Zoom is off inside the comparison**, and the hint under the image says so. At
100 % a 2 MP result and a 0.5 MP original cover different parts of the subject —
that is not a comparison. Leave the comparison (⊟) and the usual click-for-100 %
inspection is back, on whichever image you are looking at.

When you **✓ Keep** a completed **✨ Upscale & improve** candidate, LDS keeps
both files but returns its original to **Undecided** automatically — so the
improved image is the one selected for training. This happens in the lightbox
and with bulk **✓ Keep**, even if you selected both tiles. Nothing is deleted:
you can still compare them, and can mark the original **Keep** again later if
you deliberately want to train on both.

If the original was deleted, rejected and purged, or simply never recorded (very
old rows), there is no button — a short amber note says why instead, so a
missing control can't be mistaken for a bug. Everything else in the lightbox —
✂ Crop, ⇄ Mirror, ✨ Upscale & improve — is unchanged and still acts on the
image you opened.

## Compare an image with the dataset reference photo

⧉ *Compare with original* only exists on the two kinds of candidate above. The
question you actually ask of an ordinary generated variation is a different one
— **is this still the same person?** — and its answer is the reference photo,
which lives in another panel and is therefore never on screen beside the image
you are judging.

Open any image in the dataset full screen and it now carries
**◐ Compare with reference**. Same split view, same named panes — *Reference*
and *This image* — side by side on a wide screen, stacked on a phone. It works
on **every** image, generated or imported, not only on improve candidates.

**Each pane fits its own image**, and that is the honest thing to do here: the
reference is a square head crop and the image beside it may be a full-body plan,
so there is no shared scale to promise. The hint under the panes says
*different framings* rather than *same scale* — that promise belongs to the
comparison against the original, where both images really are two renderings of
one shot.

The two comparisons are **exclusive**: pressing one leaves the other, because
two pairs of panes at once are four thumbnails and prove nothing. On an improved
image both buttons are there and you can flip between the two questions; on a
plain variation only ◐ *Compare with reference* is.

A dataset with **no reference photo yet** shows no button and no warning — the
reference panel already asks you for one, and a second nudge here would be noise
on a screen that cannot act on it. Zoom is off inside this comparison too; leave
it (⊟) for the usual click-for-100 % inspection.

## Tune the Bank filter thresholds

The filter chips (🌫 Blurry, 📐 Small, ≈ Duplicates…) are verdicts, and every
verdict comes from a number. Those numbers used to live only in
*Settings ▸ Captioning & quality*, three screens away from the bank you were
triaging. They are now also under the chips themselves: open **🎚 Filter
thresholds** above the grid.

It is the **same setting in both places** — one value, seen twice — so anything
you change here applies to **every bank**, and the panel says so at the top.

The twelve knobs are grouped by the question they answer: **Image quality**,
**Duplicates**, **Size & framing**, **Content**, **Style**. The first two are
open by default; the rest fold away, and a folded group tells you how many of
its values you have moved off the default.

Three things each control tells you that a bare number cannot:

- **Which way catches more.** "Stricter" is not a direction. *Duplicate
  distance* is a distance in hash bits — **raise** it to catch more
  near-duplicates. *Semantic duplicate similarity* is a similarity — **lower**
  it to catch more. They sit side by side and they move opposite ways, so each
  field spells its own direction out in a sentence next to the input.
- **When it takes effect.** Eight of them re-sort the bank the moment you save,
  because the scan stores raw measurements and the verdicts are recomputed on
  every read — no rescan, ever. The other four are baked into stored groups by a
  pass, so they carry a button that re-runs that pass on the spot. Re-grouping
  duplicates is cheap: it walks the stored hashes and decodes nothing.
- **How many images it would touch.** As you change a read-time value, the panel
  asks the server how many images that number *would* flag and shows
  \`1 240 → 3 019 images flagged\` before you save anything. Nothing is written
  until you press **Save**.

Every field has **↺ Reset to default** (it only appears when the value is not
the default), and the header carries **↺ Reset all to defaults**. The defaults
come from the server, so they are always the real shipped values.

### What editing an image costs it

Crop, ✂ Mirror, ↺ Rotate and the watermark cleaners **overwrite** the file the
trainer will later copy verbatim, so whatever they discard is discarded for good.
They all follow one rule: **keep the file's format and re-encode it without losing
pixels.** A PNG stays a PNG, a WebP is rewritten losslessly (crop it ten times and the tenth
is identical to the first), and the file keeps a name that matches what is inside
it. JPEG is the exception nobody can fix — it has no lossless mode — so a JPEG is
re-saved at the highest practical quality with no chroma subsampling rather than
converted to something heavier to protect pixels that were already lossy.

Two honest caveats:

- **A large crop still resamples.** A box longer than 1024 px is normalised *down*
  to a 1024 px long side, and only the *encoding* is lossless — that downscale
  never can be. A box at or under 1024 px is a pure cut, so it is lossless end to
  end, as is the watermark **✂ auto-crop**, which only cuts and never resizes.
- **Files get bigger.** A cropped photo that used to weigh ~200 KB now weighs
  ~950 KB. That is the price of not throwing pixels away. Thumbnails and the
  copies uploaded to a generation API are unaffected: they stay small on purpose.

### A crop is never enlarged

A crop used to be stretched *up* to a 1024 px long side as well: select 240×180
and the file stored was 1024×768. That enlargement invented no detail — shrinking
such a file back recovers the real crop almost exactly — and since the encoder
went lossless it cost roughly **6× the bytes** for nothing. A crop now keeps its
own size, and only comes *down* to 1024 px.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- **Your dataset can end up mixing image sizes.** That is fine — training buckets
  images by size — but a tile cropped out of a small area really does carry less
  detail than a native shot of the same framing, and it always did; it just used
  to look like 1024 px.
- **The composition meter says so.** The old ⚠ *Upscaled* line is now
  ⚠ *Under training resolution*. It fires on the same measurement and means the
  same thing it always meant: this framing bucket is filled by cropping far into
  photos rather than by native shots — add native shots for it. (Images imported
  with the automatic head-crop *are* still enlarged to 1024, so both shapes land
  under the same warning.)

Images cropped **before** this change keep the enlarged pixels they have.

Images you cropped **before** this changed keep the pixels they have — nothing is
re-processed retroactively, and re-cropping an already-degraded file cannot bring
back what the old encoder removed.

## Why a ↻ re-run button is greyed out

A bank runs **one pass at a time**. While a ✨ Score, a Quality scan or a
Launch all is walking it, the ↻ buttons in this panel are disabled — and each
one says which pass is holding the bank and how far it has got, for example
*✨ Score pass is running on this bank — 137 / 412*. Wait for it to land, or
press **Stop** in the ⏳ progress bar at the top of the bank; the buttons come
back by themselves the moment the bank is free.

When a re-run does start, the button reports what the pass produced right where
you pressed it: **\`Done — 12 duplicate groups · 34 images (was 9 · 26)\`**. If
your new value groups exactly the same images it says so — *unchanged* — rather
than leaving you unable to tell a no-op from a pass that never ran.

## Rotate a sideways image

Scraped folders and phone exports are full of shots lying on their side. Both
places you meet an image can turn it a quarter turn, and neither charges you for
it. (Asked for by 1Tomber, GitHub issue #17.)

**In a dataset**, open the image (click its tile) and use **↺ Rotate left** /
**↻ Rotate right** in the bar under the picture, next to ⇄ Mirror. The file
keeps its name, its caption, its status and its format — a PNG stays a PNG, a
WEBP stays a WEBP. Four turns bring you back to exactly where you started:
measured on the shipped encoder, a PNG and a WEBP come back **byte-identical**
after going all the way round, so a mis-click costs nothing. The one exception
is a JPEG, which the format itself forces to be re-encoded on every save: at the
quality LDS writes (95, no chroma subsampling) that is around 46 dB PSNR — far
below anything visible, and it barely grows with more turns — but it is not
free, so it is worth knowing. Datasets normally hold WEBP, so this mostly
concerns files restored from an old backup.

Rotation is deliberately **not** part of ✂ Crop, even though that is where you
might look for it first. Cropping **resamples** the image — it rescales the box
you drew to a 1024 px long side — and resampling costs detail no matter how
carefully the result is then saved. A quarter turn resamples nothing at all: it
just moves existing pixels to new coordinates. Sending it through the crop lane
would make it pay a price it does not owe.

**In a bank**, your own folder is never written to — so a bank rotation does not
touch your files at all. The turn is remembered against the image and applied to
what the app shows you and to what it copies when you **⬆ Promote**; your
original keeps its exact bytes, whatever you do. Select the images and use
**↺ Rotate left** / **↻ Rotate right** in the selection bar — pinned to the
bottom of the screen once anything is selected — to fix a whole sideways batch
at once, or turn one image without leaving **▶ Review** with the
↺ / ↻ buttons (keyboard: \`[\` and \`]\`). Rotating in Review never decides
anything — the image stays under your cursor so you can judge it once it is the
right way up.

One caveat worth stating: the analysis passes (Subject, ✨ Score, Framing)
still read the original file, so turning an image does **not** re-run them. Turn
first, then run the passes if you want them to see it upright.

## Crop and upscale inside a bank

A bank is where the filtering and the curation happen, but reframing or
upscaling a shot used to mean leaving it: promote into a dataset, edit there,
export into a **new** bank, and start curating again. Both edits now happen in
the bank itself, so the loop is *curate → edit → re-analyse → promote*, in one
place. (Asked for by nofaceman on Discord, backed by mr.arrow.)

**✂ Crop** is per image, in **▶ Review** — the only place a bank shows a picture
big enough to draw a box on. Open Review (or press ▶ on a tile), then click
**✂ Crop** or press \`C\`. Drag the box, or snap it to a ratio, and confirm.
Cropping decides nothing: the image stays under your cursor so you can judge it
once it is framed properly.

**Nothing is resampled here**, and that is the one real difference from the crop
inside a dataset. A dataset crop rescales the box you drew to a 1024 px long
side, because a dataset image is training material and that is its size. A bank
sits *upstream* of that choice — shrinking here would pick your training
resolution before you have even picked a dataset, and would do it silently. So a
bank crop is a pure cut: it keeps the pixels inside the box, and the dataset
still decides the size when it imports.

**✨ Upscale & improve** is a pass, on the **✂ Edits** panel (⚙ Passes). It takes
the same kept / undecided / unkept / selection scope as everything else, which
matters more here than anywhere: this one spends GPU-minutes **per image**. Pick
the engine on the panel — **Klein** re-renders detail from a prompt (sharper, and
skin and colour can shift) or **SeedVR2** resolves detail and leaves the original
look alone — then launch. It runs in the background with a progress bar, and ⏹
Stop ends it between two images, keeping everything already done. Unlike the
dataset version, there is no candidate to validate: a bank *is* the review, so
the result replaces what the bank shows.

**Your own files are never written to.** Both edits land in a copy the app keeps
next to the bank, exactly like the watermark cleaning. **↩ Revert** on the ✂
Edits panel throws those copies away — for the selection, or for the whole bank —
and gives you back the image it started from, including any rotation the edit had
absorbed. In ▶ Review, **↩ Revert edit** does it for the image on screen.

Two consequences worth knowing. First, an edit **clears every measurement taken
from the old pixels**, so ✨ Score, 📐 Framing and the rest pass over those images
again — which is the point: a sharpness score read off the shot before you cropped
it describes an image the bank no longer holds. Second, ✨ Upscale & improve does
not re-run on an image it has already improved; ↩ Revert is how you ask for a
second attempt, and it is one click.

## Repaint one detail without regenerating the image

Two people asked for this from opposite directions on the same week: one wanted
the watermark remover pointed at a necklace and some skin blemishes, the other
wanted to fix a small glitch in a fresh picture without regenerating the whole
thing. Same hole.

The app already had the hard part. **🧽 Clean** repaints exactly the box you draw
and leaves every pixel outside it **byte-identical** — but its instruction was
frozen on "reconstruct a clean, natural image", so it could only ever be aimed at
a watermark. **✦ Edit**, the other lane, takes any instruction but re-renders the
**whole** image, which drifts outside the area you cared about.

**✦ Repair** is the first lane with both. Open the image (click its tile) and press
**✦ Repair** in the action bar. Draw the zone, type what should be there —
*"remove the necklace"* — and press **✦ Repair** again. Only that zone is
repainted. Everything outside it comes back exactly as it was, to the byte.

**Two shapes, one button.** Inside that dialog you choose how to point at the
area:

- **▭ Box** — drag a rectangle. The app crops a square around it and works on
  that crop, so it is quick and its memory use does not depend on how large the
  photo is. Right for a mark in a corner.
- **🖌 Brush** — paint over the thing itself, with a size slider, an eraser and
  Clear. The model sees your paint plus a generous ring of context around it —
  a localized touch-up travels as a native-resolution crop, and only a paint
  job that spans most of the frame sends the whole (size-capped) picture.
  Right for jewelry, glasses, straps — anything a rectangle would only enclose
  by taking a lot of its surroundings with it. Pixels you did not paint are
  copied from your file either way.

Both work under a finger, so this is usable from a phone. The brush was
contributed by OneCodingDude on GitHub.

**The brush needs one small install.** The masked pass runs on **LanPaint**, a
training-free inpainting sampler (a ~1 MB ComfyUI node pack, no Python
dependencies): Klein is an edit model, not an inpaint-trained one, and
conditioning it like one is what used to hand back a smeary patch — reported by
charlesangus on GitHub, and exactly what LanPaint exists to fix. Setup ▸ the
**LanPaint sampler** row installs it; restart ComfyUI afterwards so it loads.
Your paint is also grown by a few pixels before the model sees it, so the
edges of the removed thing get rebuilt instead of leaving a halo — and the
best prompts describe **what should be behind** (*"bare skin"*, *"plain
wall"*) rather than naming what to remove.

The 🚩 button next to it opens the same editor from the other intention — you
spotted a watermark the scan missed. Same screen, same zones; what differs is
whether you press 🧽 Clean or ✦ Repair once you are there.

A few things worth knowing:

- **It says nothing about watermarks.** A repair does not flag, clear or stamp
  anything: the image keeps whatever watermark state it had. It is an edit you
  asked for, not a verdict.
- **Your original is preserved first.** The master is copied aside *before*
  anything is written, so a repair that fails costs you nothing — the file is
  left exactly as it was.
- **An empty description is refused**, on purpose. Falling back to the watermark
  sentence would repaint your zone with an intention you never expressed.
- **↩ Undo puts the previous image back**, one step deep, so trying another
  description costs nothing — which is the normal way to use this: look, not
  right, change the sentence, go again. The dialog stays open after a repair for
  exactly that. The undo is consumed once used, and it never reaches the
  write-once original kept for ↩ Undo cleaning — undoing a repair must not throw
  away a watermark clean you made earlier and still want.
- It runs on Klein through ComfyUI, one round-trip per repair.

**On a picture you just generated, too.** Open a generated image full size — on
the Canvas, or from a checkpoint gallery — and press **✦ Repair** next to ⬇ and
✨. Same gesture, same guarantee: a stray finger or an unwanted object no longer
means throwing away the render you liked and rolling the dice again.

## Clean the watermarks a bank found

**🚩 Find watermarks** flags the images carrying an overlaid logo, URL or
@username. Removing them used to mean promoting the watermark into a dataset
first and cleaning it there; the bank now does it itself, in **two steps you
launch by hand** — cheapest and safest first:

1. **✂ Auto-crop** cuts off the marks sitting in a border strip. No model, no
   GPU, no invented pixel: it simply trims the band up to the mark, and only
   when the image stays big enough to train on. Anything it can't crop that way
   is left flagged, on purpose.
2. **🧽 Inpaint** repaints what's left. **LaMa** (fast, non-generative) handles
   small off-centre marks and leaves marks *on the subject* flagged; **Klein**
   (slower, via ComfyUI) also clears those. Each engine says what to install
   when it isn't ready, and the button stays off rather than failing mid-pass.

Each step shows how many images it still has to work on and how many it has
already handled, so you can see where the funnel stands. **Your source files are
never modified** — a cleaned image is a copy the app keeps beside the bank's
thumbnails. That copy is what the grid shows, and what **⬆ Promote** sends to
the dataset, so a cleaned bank produces a clean dataset. **↩ Undo cleaning**
just deletes those copies and flags the images again, and **👁 Before / after**
flips a sample between the cleaned version and your untouched original.

If a bank was scanned by an older version, its flagged images carry no recorded
mark position; the panel says so and one more **🚩 Find watermarks** run makes
them cleanable.

### Who decided an image is watermarked

**🚩 Find watermarks** can run two ways, and the panel says which one produced
the verdicts you are looking at ("Judged 1 240 by the detector, 300 by the vision
model") and which one a new run would use.

- **The vision model** — the way that has always worked. It asks the local vision
  model, in words, whether the picture carries a mark, once per image. About
  1.7 seconds each, so about fifteen hours on a 30 000-image bank.
- **The watermark detector** — an optional extra (Setup ▸ Quality tools). A small
  classifier scores each image in about **0.14 second**, and a second model marks
  where the logo sits so the two cleaning steps still have a box to work on. It
  needs no Ollama at all.

Install nothing and nothing changes. Install the extra and it takes over on its
own; there is no switch to flip. What it costs is ~0.9 GB of weights, downloaded
once into the same Python the **✨ Score** pass already uses.

**How good is it, measured.** On 110 images pulled from a real bank and labelled
by eye — half of them hard on purpose: faint corner logos, semi-transparent
handles across the subject, an \`OnlyFans.com/…\` line barely a few pixels tall, and
clean photos containing legitimate signage — the detector at its default setting
flagged **none of the 55 clean images** and **54 of the 55 marked ones**. The
vision model, on the exact same 110, flagged one clean image and missed one marked
one. So the detector is not a downgrade in judgement; the gain you actually buy is
the ten-fold speed-up. Neither is a verdict: both are a review flag, and both leave
your source files untouched.

The one image the detector missed was a \`MET-ART.com\` line in a bottom corner
scoring 0.929, just under the 0.94 cut — and the highest-scoring clean image sat
at 0.939. The two overlap by about a hundredth, which is why the cut is a
**setting** (Settings ▸ Captioning & quality ▸ *Watermark detector sensitivity*)
and not a constant.

Images flagged **without** a position — the detector was sure there is a mark but
could not place it — stay flagged and are counted separately in the pass's report.
Draw a zone on them with **🚩 Edit mask** below, or leave them as a filter.


## Erase burned-in text — bubbles, subtitles, captions

A comic page carries its dialogue, a screencap its subtitle, a meme its
caption — and a LoRA trained on them learns the lettering along with the
subject. **🔤 Find text** reads that text and feeds the exact same cleaning
funnel as the watermarks: every block of text becomes a zone in the image's
mask, the image is flagged, and **🧽 Inpaint** repaints the zones. One funnel,
one ↩ Undo, one mask editor — a text zone behaves exactly like a zone you drew
by hand. **✂ Auto-crop never touches them**, on purpose: cropping a speech
bubble out of the middle of a page is not a thing.

The reading is done by the same OCR engine as the Video bank's **🔳 Safe
zone** pass (one Setup install serves both — *Burned-in text*, a small
Apache-2.0 package that works offline). It runs on the **CPU only**, never the
GPU, so it can scan a bank while a training run owns the card. Regular
lettering is found whatever the script — Latin, Korean, Japanese, Chinese
dialogue, subtitles and captions are all boxes to it. **Heavily stylised
lettering can escape it**: a calligraphic sound-effect with thick outlines is
drawn more than written, and the detector can miss it entirely (measured on a
real page — no threshold recovers it). Those get the hand mask in **🚩 Edit
mask**, like any zone the machine missed.

**How the repaint treats these zones.** A text zone is not handed to the
repaint model as a rectangle any more — that is what used to eat balloon
outlines. The clean now runs an outline-safe filler first: every letter is a
small closed ink shape *inside* the zone, so anything drawn **across** the
zone's edge (the balloon outline, the art) is preserved by construction; the
letters are then erased with the bubble's own background colour —
including the faint JPEG haze around them — or rebuilt by a local
inpaint when the background is graded. Only lettering sitting on busy art
still goes to the repaint model, and it gets letter-sized boxes, never the
whole rectangle. Pages cleaned before this shipped can be upgraded:
**↩ Undo cleaning**, then Clean again.

What it does *not* do, said plainly:

- it reads **positions, not words** — no transcript of your images is stored
  anywhere, the boxes are all that is kept;
- the mask holds at most **32 zones per image**; a text-heavy page that
  produces more keeps the 32 biggest blocks and the pass's report says how
  many were left out (draw those in **🚩 Edit mask** if they matter);
- images you **dismissed** stay dismissed — this pass never re-flags a row you
  already ruled on, exactly like a watermark re-scan;
- a **🚩 Find watermarks** run afterwards will not undo it: text zones survive
  the scan, and a watermark box found on the same image joins them.

**Try it on a sample before paying for the whole bank.** The launch window
carries two dials. *Try on a sample first* reads only the first N images of
the scope (deterministic — a re-read hits the same pages), so on a 9 000-page
bank you can judge the result on twenty before committing to the rest.
*Sensitivity* is the OCR confidence a line needs to become a zone — lower
catches fainter or more stylised lettering at the cost of false zones. It is
stored (one value, both surfaces), and the zones are always yours to edit
afterwards in **🚩 Edit mask**.

**The result shows up in the same window.** Launching does not close it: the
flagged pages appear below the dials with every zone drawn on them, filling
in live while the scan runs — on both surfaces (the strip shows the first
pages and says how many are flagged in total, and each tile opens the
full-size page).
Judge the zones, adjust the two dials, re-run — all without leaving the
window; a zone that landed wrong is fixed by hand in **▶ Review** /
**🚩 Edit mask** as before. Close it whenever you are done looking.

**Clean text and watermarks separately.** Once Find text has flagged
something, the repaint level grows a **What to clean** switch — *Both*,
*🔤 Text*, *🚩 Marks* — next to the LaMa/Klein engine toggle (the bank's
Watermarks panel and the dataset's Clean row both carry it, and the Clean
button's count follows the choice). The split is **by page**: a page carrying
both a watermark and text counts as text and is repainted whole — its zones
live in one mask, so one page is never split between two runs. With no
text-flagged page the switch stays hidden, because all three choices would
mean the same thing.

It works on both surfaces, at full parity — a bank's Watermarks panel
carries the **🔤 Find text** card next to 🚩 Find, and a dataset's curation
row carries the same button next to its watermark scan. Both open the same
launch window: the sample dial, the Sensitivity slider (one stored value,
whichever side you move it from), the measured count of what the run will
actually read, and the flagged-pages strip.


## Fix a watermark mask — or mark one the scan missed

The detector draws **one** box, and it is a guess: it can miss a second logo,
swallow half the face, or land beside the mark. Open **▶ Review**, walk to the
image and press **🚩 Edit mask** (shortcut \`M\`) — the same zone editor the
datasets use, on the bank image, right there.

It also opens on an image the scan flagged **nothing** on, where the button reads
**🚩 Mark a watermark** instead. This is the answer to a miss: the detector is a
classifier, and a mark tiled across a whole stock photo can score under any
sensitivity you set. **The zones you draw become the flag**, so the cleaning
steps below can act on an image the scan cleared. It works the same way in a
dataset, from the image viewer.

Drawing on an image you had **dismissed** as a false positive takes that ruling
back. The one image that refuses is one already **cleaned** — its pixels have
been replaced, so a zone drawn now would describe a picture that no longer
exists; use **↩ Undo cleaning** first.

- **+ Add zone**, then drag on the photo to draw a rectangle over the mark. Up
  to 32 zones; drag a zone to move it, its corners to resize.
- **Delete zone** removes the selected one, **Reset to detected** throws your
  zones away and puts the detector's box back.
- Every edit saves as you draw. If a save fails it says so and offers a retry —
  the zones on screen are never silently unsaved.

What the two cleaning steps then do with your mask:

- **🧽 Inpaint repaints exactly the zones you drew** — all of them, including a
  zone sitting on the subject, which is precisely what a hand mask is for.
- **✂ Auto-crop skips a hand-masked image.** A crop can only cut one border
  band; it cannot express several zones or a mark on the subject, so cropping
  the old box would remove pixels you did not point at.
- **An empty mask cleans nothing.** Delete every zone and you have said "there
  is nothing to repaint here": neither step touches that image, and the panel
  says how many are in that state instead of leaving them looking unhandled.

A flagged image an older scan left *without* a box becomes cleanable as soon as
you draw the zones yourself — that drawing is the missing information. And as
everywhere else in a bank, **your own file is never modified**: cleaning writes
a separate copy. A rotated image is shown unrotated here, because the whole
watermark lane works on your original file, which the ↻ turn never changed.


## Reject every flagged image at once

In a dataset, **🧽 Find watermarks** flags the kept images that carry an overlaid
mark. The recommended way through the pile is **🔍 Review flagged**, one image at
a time — the detector is a review flag, not a verdict, and it *does* flag clean
images sometimes. When you would rather drop the whole pile and move on,
**✕ Reject all flagged (N)** does exactly that.

Four things worth knowing before you click it:

- **The number is the number.** \`N\` is what the button will really reject, not
  how many are flagged. Small-image rescue pairs are excluded (the server refuses
  a batch containing one, so including them would reject *nothing*) and failed
  rows are excluded (the server skips them). If the two differ, the row says so
  in plain text rather than showing you the bigger figure.
- **Nothing is deleted.** Rejected images stay on disk and simply leave the
  training set. To bring any of them back: **Show ▸ Rejected** in the grid,
  select, then **✓ Keep**.
- **It clears the watermark flags.** That is the one thing rejecting destroys:
  after the click, 🔍 Review flagged is empty and nothing records which images
  had been flagged. Re-run 🧽 Find watermarks to flag them again.
- **Stop is available while a scan runs.** The ⏹ Stop button in the progress
  banner ends the scan at the next image; everything already judged is kept, and
  running 🧽 Find watermarks again finishes the rest.

Which engine does the flagging is a setting — **Settings ▸ Captioning & quality ▸
Watermark detection** — and it applies to datasets and banks alike. *Auto* uses
the optional watermark detector when it is installed and the vision model
otherwise, which is what the app has always done. Pin *Watermark detector*
without the extra installed and the scan still runs, on the vision model, and
says so with the link to install it. Only the detector can flag an image
**without a position**; those are counted apart, 🧽 Clean leaves them alone, and
you can draw the zone in 🔍 Review flagged. Images you dismissed as false
positives are skipped by every later scan — **⟲ Rescan incl. dismissed** is the
only way to have them judged again, which is what you want after changing engine.


## A bank and a dataset never share files

A dataset and an image bank can hand images to each other in both directions,
and both directions **copy**. That is not an implementation detail — it is the
rule the whole flow rests on:

The files generated for **ai-toolkit are not LDS's dataset registry**. At launch,
LDS freezes a disposable training export (kept images, captions and a freshly
generated job config) from its own Dataset rows. Bank/Dataset identity, analysis
history and comparisons stay in LDS's database plus its SHA-bound snapshot/cache
sidecars; they are not reconstructed from an old ai-toolkit config file.

- **Bank → dataset** (**⬆ Promote**) writes new files into the dataset.
- **Dataset → bank** (**🗃 Import to bank**, on the dataset) copies the dataset's
  kept images into a folder of the bank's own. Both choices retain the
  Dataset-owned captions, keep/reject curation, framing, watermark and
  provenance. Its dialog defaults to **Reuse compatible final-file analysis**;
  **Start fresh analysis** skips only reuse of prior analysis, not that metadata.
  The AI **Face**, **Score** and **SigLIP 2 semantic** results are not reused after
  normalization or another transformation because they are no longer proved.

Neither ever *points* at the other's files. The reason is that the two containers
have opposite contracts. A dataset **owns** its images; a bank merely **points**
at a live folder it does not own — which is exactly why 🗑 **Delete rejected** is
allowed to remove files from it. Put a bank on a dataset's folder and that button
stops deleting your rejects and starts deleting the dataset's training images.

So the app refuses it. If you paste a dataset's image folder into **➕ Create
bank** — or into **📦 Move folder** for an existing bank — you get a refusal
that names the dataset and points you at **🗃 Import to bank** instead. The check
looks through the disguises: a subfolder of the dataset, the folder *containing*
all datasets, a different letter case, forward slashes instead of backslashes,
and symlinks or Windows junctions that resolve to the same place.

**If you already have such a bank** (it was possible before this check existed),
nothing is repaired or deleted behind your back. Opening it shows a red banner
naming the dataset, and 🗑 Delete rejected is refused on that bank — everything
else keeps working, so you can finish triaging. When you are ready, either
**📦 Move folder** to point the bank at a folder of its own, or remove the bank
(removing a bank never touches files).

The dataset's own folder is shown at the top of the dataset, with a **⧉ Copy**
button, so you never have to go hunting for it in a file manager — which is how
this trap was found in the first place.


## Two banks, one card (banks that share a name)

Sometimes one collection lives in two folders — an export split across disks, a
scrape that grew a second destination, a phone dump and a laptop dump of the same
shoot. You want them curated as one thing while the files stay exactly where they
are.

**Give the two banks the same name and they become one card.** Nothing is merged
and nothing is copied: every image still belongs to exactly one bank, on its own
disk, in its own folder. The card is a view — combined counts, one **⏳ Queue the
group…**, one **⬆ Promote the group…** — with all the members one click away
under **▸ N banks**, each keeping its own rename, 📦 move, ✕ delete and preview.

The rule is deliberately small enough to keep in your head:

- names must match **exactly**, ignoring only surrounding spaces. **Case
  matters**: "Telegram" and "telegram" stay apart. Merging them silently would be
  a surprise you cannot undo by looking at the screen; not merging them is fixed
  by an obvious rename.
- it takes **two**. A single bank with a name is just a bank.
- **Keep separate**, on any member, takes that bank out of the grouping. It is a
  property of the *bank*: rename it away and back and it is still separate,
  because clearing it for you would silently re-group something you deliberately
  split.

**Renaming is the whole mechanism.** Rename a bank into the group's name and it
joins; rename it away and it leaves. Delete a member and the group shrinks — at
one member it stops being a group and the last bank is a bank again. The
confirmation for a delete says what it always said: only triage data goes, the
source folder is untouched, and the *other* banks are not affected.

**Promoting the group** sends every kept image across its members into one
dataset, one bank after another. There is no image picker — a group card has no
grid, so it is "everything kept here that is not already in the dataset". Two
members holding the same photo cost **one** dataset image; the import collapses
duplicates. It is refused outright if any member has a pass running, before
anything is created.

**Queueing the group** adds one entry **per bank**, exactly like queueing them by
hand. They still run one at a time — and unlike unrelated banks, that holds even
across machines: the group is one card, so only one of its members is ever
running, whichever machine each was sent to.

One honest limit: if two members point at **overlapping folders on disk**, the
card's combined counts add the same images more than once. The card says so.
Promotion is still correct — the duplicates are collapsed on the way in — but the
number above it is a sum of what each bank believes it holds.

## Move a bank folder to another disk

A bank points at a folder *in place*, but nothing it computes lives in that
folder: the quality scores, duplicate groups, face clusters, captions and every
keep/reject decision are stored against the image row, and each row remembers
its file *relative* to the bank's folder. So moving a 30 000-image bank to
another drive costs nothing — you just have to tell the app where it went.

You can do this in either order. **📦 Move folder** sits in the bank's header
next to its path (and **📦** on the bank's card in the list), so you can open it
before touching anything to see what the app will ask for; it also appears inside
the warning shown once the app notices the folder is gone, if you moved first.
Paste or browse to the new folder
and press **🔍 Check folder**. Nothing is written yet: the app walks the
candidate folder and tells you how many of *this bank's* images are in there and
how many are not. Paste it however you like — Windows' *Copy as path* wraps the
path in quotes, and a trailing \`\\\` or forward slashes are equally fine; the field
then shows the folder the app actually resolved, so what you confirm is what it
will use.

- **All of them found** → confirm, and the bank is repointed with every score
  and decision intact.
- **Some found, some missing** → you can still confirm. Nothing is deleted:
  rows whose file didn't come along keep their analysis and simply read as
  missing until the file comes back.
- **None found** → refused. That folder is a *different* folder, not a moved
  one — the usual cause is picking the parent of the folder you moved.

The app never deletes a row on its own, and an analysis pass run while the files
are away no longer degrades them either: a file that is *absent* is not a file
that is *broken*, so the pass stops and tells you the folder appears to have
moved instead of marking thousands of images unusable.

## Images you deleted from the folder yourself

The bank's folder walk is deliberately **additive**: it registers files that
appeared and it *never* removes a row. That rule is what makes an unplugged
drive survivable — otherwise one walk with the disk missing would erase a triage
built over hours.

The cost is that a file you really did delete by hand is counted as *missing*
forever, and the count never comes down. The bank's warning line now carries the
way out: **Accept — remove N from this bank**, next to **📦 Move folder**. It
is on the bank's card in the list and in the workspace header, wherever the
warning appears.

- It removes **rows only**. Nothing on disk is touched — those files are already
  gone.
- What you lose with each row is that image's keep/reject decision and its
  scores. The confirmation says so before you commit.
- It is **never automatic**, and it never runs on the app's initiative. That is
  the same principle as everywhere else in the bank: the app reports, you decide.
- It is **not offered while the folder is unreachable**, and refused by the
  server if asked anyway. With the drive unplugged every row looks missing, so
  accepting would delete the whole bank. If the folder simply *moved*, use
  **📦 Move folder** instead — that keeps everything.


## Make Score use a GPU Python you already have

The **✨ Score** pass (aesthetic · NSFW · style) runs in its own small Python
environment, and that environment deliberately carries **CPU-only PyTorch**: a
first install stays a few hundred megabytes instead of pulling ~2.5 GB of CUDA
wheels onto machines that may have no card at all.

On a machine that *does* have one, that default is expensive — CLIP measures
about **336 ms per image on the CPU against ~15 ms on a recent card**, so a
30 000-image bank is the difference between a coffee break and most of an
afternoon. The bank says so: when Score is about to run on the CPU on a machine
with an NVIDIA card, an amber note gives you the estimate and a button, **⚡ Use
a GPU Python I already have**.

That button is the point. If you train LoRAs or run ComfyUI, this machine
*already* has a PyTorch with working CUDA. Score can simply borrow it — no
download, no third environment to maintain.

The dialog lists the interpreters the app knows about (the environment it built
for scoring, ai-toolkit's, ComfyUI's, its own) and reports each one **package by
package**:

- **GPU ready** — everything the pass imports is there *and* PyTorch sees the
  card. Pick it and the next Score run is minutes instead of hours.
- **Missing packages** — the reason is named. The common one is an interpreter
  with a perfect CUDA PyTorch but no **OpenCLIP**: Score needs \`open_clip\` and
  \`transformers\`/\`timm\` too, so CUDA alone is not enough. Such an interpreter is
  **refused**, on purpose — accepting it would trade slow-but-working scoring for
  an import error an hour into the pass.
- **CPU only** — it can run the pass, it just has no usable CUDA.
- **No answer** — the path is not a working interpreter (moved venv, unplugged
  drive). Nothing changes.

**The app never installs anything into an environment it did not create.** Your
ai-toolkit venv runs your training and ComfyUI's runs your generation; a silent
\`pip install\` into either is not something a dataset tool gets to do. When a
package is missing the dialog shows you the exact command and leaves the choice
to you — run it in a terminal, then hit **↻ Check again** and the row updates.

**Not listed? That field is not a fallback.** Most machines have neither
ai-toolkit nor ComfyUI where the app looks — or at all — so entering a path
yourself is a first-class route, checked exactly the same way. Paste an
interpreter *or* the environment folder that contains it: a venv, a conda or
miniconda env, a uv venv, a portable bundle, the system Python, something on a
second disk. Spaces, accents and quotes around the path are fine ("Copy as path"
on Windows wraps it in quotes; that is handled). The layout is never assumed —
the app knocks on the shapes an environment can have and keeps whichever one
actually answers.

No version of PyTorch or CUDA is required. The only question asked is the one
that matters: do the packages import, and does PyTorch see a card. An old card
on cu118, a 50-series that only works on cu128, a nightly build — all fine.

**No NVIDIA card?** Then there is nothing to fix, and the app says so plainly
instead of suggesting a CUDA install you could not use. Borrowing an interpreter
is still offered, for one honest reason: if another Python here already has the
packages, you can skip installing them a second time. It will not be faster.

**What borrowing a GPU interpreter changes besides speed.** This is the one part
that is not a free win, and it is worth reading before you pick. A Score pass
that runs **on the GPU takes the card exclusively** for its whole duration:
ComfyUI's VRAM is freed before the pass starts, a training run cannot begin until
it finishes, and every other GPU pass — including banks waiting in the queue —
answers *"GPU busy"* meanwhile. On the CPU-only default, Score holds nothing and
happily runs alongside your generation. So a fast pass costs you the card while
it runs; a slow one costs you time but nothing else. The dialog states this on
every CUDA row, and once a GPU interpreter is in use the bank panel keeps saying
it.

**If you borrow ComfyUI's own Python**, one extra thing to know: Score frees
ComfyUI's VRAM, but it does not close ComfyUI, and CUDA start-up in the borrowed
interpreter can stall against a process still holding the card. If a first pass
sits at zero and never moves, close ComfyUI and start it again. You are not stuck
either way — a pass that produces no output at all for **15 minutes** is stopped
for you, the GPU is released, and the bank says what happened instead of leaving
everything refusing "GPU busy".

**Back to the app default** puts everything back exactly as it was. The choice is
reversible at any time, and the note under the passes always says which
interpreter is in use. If you never open this dialog, nothing changes: an install
that works today keeps working, untouched.


## Build the SigLIP 2 index on a GPU Python you already have

The **SigLIP 2** semantic engine is the same story with a different dependency
list. Its index is built by a worker that lives in the app's own environment —
the CPU-only one — so on a machine with a card the index crawls for the same
reason Score used to.

SigLIP 2 is the lighter of the two: **92.9 M parameters against 303 M for the
CLIP ViT-L/14 Score runs**, measured at about **105 ms per image on the CPU**
rather than 336. Lighter is not free: a 30 000-image bank is still the better
part of an hour.

The **Semantic engine** panel now tells you which device the index will actually
use, and when a card is sitting idle it offers the same button, **⚡ Use a GPU
Python I already have**. It is the same detector, the same dialog and the same
promise — with one difference that matters:

**The dependency list is SigLIP 2's, not Score's.** The semantic worker never
imports \`open_clip\` or \`timm\`. An interpreter Score refuses for a missing
OpenCLIP — the most common shape of a ComfyUI venv — can be perfectly good here,
and refusing it would be a lie about a worker that does not need it. What it
*does* need is a **Transformers recent enough to carry \`Siglip2Model\`** (4.49 or
newer). That one is checked by really looking for the class, not just for the
package: an older \`transformers\` imports fine and then dies at model load, an
hour into an index. Such an interpreter is refused, and the repair line the
dialog hands you carries the version floor.

**Borrowing an interpreter downloads nothing here.** The pinned SigLIP 2
checkpoint lives in the app's own data folder, not inside the interpreter, so a
borrowed Python needs no copy of it.

**Where the index runs is not where anything is installed.** Setup ▸ Quality
tools always installs SigLIP 2 into the environment the app built, whatever you
picked in this dialog — including when you later hit Install/repair, which now
*keeps* your choice instead of quietly putting the index back on the CPU.


## Run the watermark detector on a GPU Python you already have

The **🚩 Find** scan is the third pass with the same story. Installing the
watermark detector (Setup ▸ Quality tools) builds it a small environment with
**CPU-only PyTorch** — the same deliberate default as Score — and *pins* that
environment as the detector's interpreter. On a machine with a card the scan
therefore ran on the CPU, silently, however good the GPU sitting idle next to
it was.

Two things changed:

- **The Bank's 🚩 Watermarks panel now says it.** When the fast detector is
  installed but its Python cannot reach CUDA on a machine that has a card, an
  amber note names the situation and offers the same button as Score and
  SigLIP 2: **⚡ Use a GPU Python I already have**. The pass summary also
  reports which device the scan *actually* ran on — "(detector on GPU, …)" or
  "(detector on CPU, …)" — read back from the scan itself, not from a guess.
- **The picker speaks the detector's own dependency list.** It never imports
  \`open_clip\`, \`timm\` or even NumPy, so the ComfyUI interpreter Score refuses
  is usually perfect here. What it *does* need is a **Transformers carrying
  both halves of the cascade** — the SigLIP classifier and the Grounding-DINO
  locator (4.40 or newer). Both classes are really looked for, not assumed
  from the package name, and an interpreter missing either is refused with the
  exact repair command.

**Borrowing an interpreter downloads nothing.** The detector's pinned weights
live under the app's models folder, not inside the interpreter. And as
everywhere in this dialog family, nothing is ever installed into an
environment the app did not build — **Back to the app default** reverts the
choice at any time, after which the scan falls back to Score's interpreter and
then the app's own, exactly as before.

Score and the semantic index are chosen separately. Pointing one at an
interpreter never moves the other, and **Back to the app default** undoes either
on its own.

## The video bank (turn a folder of rushes into shots)

Videos are a different kind of material and they get their own bank. On the
**🗃️ Bank** page the switch at the top right says which kind you are making —
**🖼 Images** or **🎬 Video**. This matters more than it looks: an image bank
skips every \`.mp4\` you drop into its folder **without a word**, so a folder of
video used to look like an empty bank.

A video bank triages **shots**, not files. One two-hour rush is not something you
can judge; the three hundred shots inside it are.

1. **Create it** — name it, point it at the folder. Every \`.mp4\`, \`.mov\`, \`.mkv\`,
   \`.webm\` and \`.avi\` under it (subfolders included) is inventoried in place.
   Nothing is copied, and **no pass ever modifies your files** — scanning,
   cutting and building all write elsewhere. The one thing that adds to that
   folder is a scrape you send to this bank yourself (next step).
1bis. **🕸 Scrape the web into a video bank** — you don't need a folder of rushes
   you assembled by hand. Unfold **🕸 Scrape the web into a video bank** on the
   video bank list, choose a destination, then scan a URL and pick clips exactly
   as you would pick images. The scanner has always listed videos — RedGifs,
   Erome, Picazor, TikTok, X, Civitai and the gallery sources all return them —
   and the picker now shows them, with a ▶ badge and their length. They are
   downloaded, inventoried on the spot, and cut into shots when you run the
   passes above.

   Two things are worth knowing:

   - **Nothing is judged on the way in**, exactly like the image bank. Length,
     motion, sharpness and near-duplicates are verdicts the **📊 Measure
     quality** pass produces, with thresholds you move. A clip refused at
     download time is one you could never have reviewed.
   - **Any bank can receive them, and the picker says where they will land.**
     A **new bank** gets a folder of its own under the app's own storage. **Add
     to an existing bank** offers every bank you have, including one you pointed
     at your own footage — the clips are simply added to the folder that bank
     follows, and the picker prints that folder's path before you start.
     Choosing the bank is the whole confirmation; there is no second checkbox.
     The one destination that is refused is a bank sitting on a *dataset's* own
     folder, where new files would end up inside training material.
2. **▶ Run everything** chains the three passes in the only order that works:
   **scan** reads what each file is (length, size, frame rate), **find shots**
   cuts it at its shot boundaries, and **make thumbnails** grabs one frame from
   the middle of each shot. Each pass is also available on its own, and the box
   above the buttons always names the one step to take next — run them out of
   order and each simply finds nothing to do and reports success.
3. **Triage** — the grid is thumbnails, and only thumbnails. Click one to watch
   exactly that shot, \`←\`/\`→\` to move, \`K\` to keep, \`R\` to reject. Filter by
   status, or click a file in the **Files** list to see only its shots. For a
   whole bank at speed, **⌨ Burst mode** judges shots straight from the grid,
   one keystroke each — see *Triage a video bank from the keyboard* below.
4. **🎬 Build the dataset** encodes what you kept. This is the only step that
   writes video.

**Nothing is encoded while you triage.** A bank stores where each shot starts and
ends — no clip file exists until you promote — which is why a bank of hundreds of
shots costs no disk space, and why the player streams the original file rather
than a preview.

**A missing piece never disables the whole lane.** The video extra is three
independent things: reading files, finding shots, and encoding clips. The app
says which one is missing and what still works — with no ffmpeg, for example, you
can scan, cut, watch and triage an entire bank, and only the final build waits.

## Triage a video bank from the keyboard

A rush of two hours becomes three hundred shots, and judging them by clicking a
tile, clicking ✓ or ✕, then coming back to the grid is three gestures each. **⌨
Burst mode**, above the gallery, makes it one keystroke.

Turn it on and one tile carries the cursor — an amber ring and a **▸ next**
marker under the thumbnail. From there:

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| \`K\` | Keep this shot |
| \`R\` | Reject this shot |
| \`P\` | Put it back to untriaged |
| \`S\` or \`→\` | Move on without deciding |
| \`←\` | Move back one shot |
| \`U\` | Undo the last decision, and go to that shot |
| \`Home\` | Jump to the first untriaged shot |
| \`?\` | Show or hide the shortcut panel |
| \`Esc\` | Leave burst mode |

They are the same keys as the image bank's **▶ Review** — \`K\` keep, \`R\` reject,
\`S\` skip, \`←\` back, \`Esc\` out — because a reflex that is right on one screen and
wrong on the next is worse than no reflex. \`P\`, \`U\` and \`Home\` are this lane's
own: a video bank has three verdicts where the image review has two.

Four things are worth knowing before you lean on it:

- **The cursor jumps to the next shot you have not judged yet**, not simply the
  next tile. On a half-triaged bank that is most of the speed. Untick
  **Auto-advance** and the cursor stays put instead, so \`K\` then \`R\` corrects
  the same shot — useful when you are being careful rather than fast.
- **It never wraps.** When nothing untriaged is left ahead of the cursor, the
  bar says so — and says how many are still sitting *behind* it, with \`Home\` to
  go back to the first. A run that silently looped back to the top would put
  your next keystroke on a shot you did not expect.
- **Undo goes back one step at a time, and shows you what it fixed.** The bar
  always names the decision it would take back (*"↩ U undoes ✕ Reject on 0:12 –
  0:15"*) and how many steps are left in the net — ten. Each \`U\` restores what
  the shot actually was before, so undoing a reject on a shot you had already
  kept puts the **keep** back, not a blank. The offer sits in the bar rather
  than in a toast on purpose: at one keystroke a second a toast is replaced
  before it can be read.
- **Your keystrokes never wait for the network.** The tile flips and the cursor
  moves at once; the decisions are sent behind you, one request at a time, and a
  run of identical verdicts goes out as a single batch. The bar shows *saving
  N…* while anything is still unacknowledged — a run that has ended is not the
  same thing as a run that is saved. If a save does fail, nothing is guessed:
  the grid is reloaded from the bank and the message says how many decisions did
  not land.

Shortcuts never fire while you are typing in the search box or a threshold
field, and the mode and the auto-advance setting are remembered for next time.

## Measure your shots, and choose your own cuts

**📊 Measure quality** reads every frame of every shot in one pass and scores the
four things that quietly ruin a video dataset: shots that barely move, shots that
are all blur, black moments, and frozen stretches. The pass stores raw numbers,
never verdicts — so changing a threshold later re-sorts the bank instantly, with
no rescan. Stopping is safe; a re-run picks up where it left off.

Flagged shots get an **amber ⚑ mark** in the grid. Amber, not red, because a flag
is a reason to *look* — nothing is ever rejected for you. Hover the mark to see
which cuts a shot tripped.

**There are deliberately no default thresholds.** The same number that flags 2 %
of one bank flags 12 % of another — a cut only means something against *your*
bank's own distribution. Open **🎚 Quality cuts**, type a value (leave a field
empty to disable that cut), and press **👁 Preview**: it answers with how many
shots each rule would flag, per rule, before anything is applied. If a draft
would flag most of the bank, the preview says so in as many words instead of
letting you apply it by accident.

**One cut needs no measuring at all: Minimum length.** Shot detection keeps very
short cuts on purpose — a real flash cut is a real shot, and a detector that
refuses to emit one also hides genuine boundaries. The cost is a grid peppered
with half-second shots you scroll past a hundred times. Type a value in seconds
and every shorter shot wears the flag, immediately after detection, with no
measuring pass — this cut reads the shot's own bounds rather than its pixels.

Do not confuse it with the *too short* refusal you may see at promotion. That one
is your target profile's arithmetic — so many frames at so many fps — and no
setting on this panel moves it: those shots were never going to land. **Minimum
length** only decides what gets flagged for your eyes, so you can see and sort
them *before* spending triage time on them.

Two touches you get for free once shots are measured: thumbnails move from the
middle-of-shot guess to the **sharpest measured frame**, and the freeze detector
catches the failure the averages never can — a shot that plays fine and then
hangs on a still image for a second. On a real 4.5-hour test bank that turned
out to be the most common defect of all.

**The sound is measured too, for the targets that keep it.** LTX and MiniMax H3
mux the source's audio into every clip; Wan has no audio at all and forces the
track off. So the pass also reports, per shot, **how much of it is silence** and
**its overall level in dBFS** — because a dataset of silent clips teaches the
model to be silent, and nothing about the file on disk reveals it: it is the
right length, the right sample rate, and mute. Two cuts go with them, **Silent
share** and **Loudness floor**, and they raise two different flags on purpose —
a quiet clip can be normalised, a silent one cannot be rescued.

Three states are kept apart here, and it matters:

- **no sound track** — a property of the file. Never flagged; a Wan dataset is
  supposed to look like this.
- **silent** — a track that is there and carries nothing. That is the defect.
- **not measured** — nobody has listened yet. Shots measured before this shipped
  carry no sound reading at all, and an audio cut will never flag them. **Run
  Measure again with re-measure** to fill them in; the pass otherwise skips
  everything it has already done.

### 🔳 Safe zone — the bands and the text you cannot see at thumbnail size

Two things eat a frame without ever showing up in a 90 px grid, and both are
perfectly consistent across every clip that came out of the same file — which is
exactly what a LoRA learns first:

- **Bands.** Letterbox, pillarbox, a vertical video somebody padded into 16:9, a
  4:3 broadcast scanned into a wide container. They survive a training crop.
- **Burned-in text.** Subtitles, chyrons, lower thirds, a text watermark. A model
  trained on subtitled footage does not learn the words — it learns that the
  bottom sixth of a picture is a place where letters live, and then it draws
  letter-shaped gibberish there forever.

**🔳 Safe zone** decodes three frames of each shot and measures both, then
works out the rectangle that excludes them — the *safe zone* — and how much of
the frame that rectangle keeps. Three cuts read those numbers: **Letterbox
share**, **Burned-in text share** and **Usable frame floor**. Like every cut in
this panel they are empty by default and applied at read time, so moving one
re-sorts the bank with nothing rescanned.

**Only what holds still across the three frames counts.** That is the whole
discrimination and it goes both ways: a band has to be on all three frames to be
called structural, so a fade-out never invents one; and a text zone needs a
partner in another frame, so a subtitle, a chyron and a station logo are caught
while a shop sign in a pan and a newspaper someone holds up for a second are left
alone as scene content.

**Text in the MIDDLE of a frame is the case worth understanding.** It is small,
so the text share barely moves — but there is no crop that removes it, so the
usable frame collapses. That is what the third cut is for, and its answer to "can
I save this clip by cropping" is an honest no.

**Reading text needs one small extra**, *Burned-in text* in Setup (RapidOCR, CPU
only, no GPU, and its weights ride inside the package so it works offline).
Without it the pass still runs and still measures the bands — it reports **bands
only** and stores no text reading at all, so the two text cuts flag nothing
rather than quietly clearing every shot. This is the only pass in the app that
works at half strength instead of refusing; the button stays enabled and says so
in its tooltip.

It is its own button rather than part of another pass, because unlike ✂ Duplicates
and 🎨 Look it consumes nothing: a shot can be measured the moment its file has
been scanned. It decodes three frames per shot and reads them on the CPU, so a
big bank takes real time — and it never touches the GPU, so it can run while a
training is going.

### 🩻 Defects — what a re-encode left behind

The passes above measure your *footage*: how it moves, how it is lit, how sharp
it is. This one measures the *file* — what happened to it between the camera and
your disk. Material that was uploaded, transcoded and re-uploaded a few times
carries damage that no thumbnail shows and that sits identically on every frame
of every shot from that file, which is precisely the kind of thing a LoRA learns
first and fastest.

**🩻 Defects** hands each source file to ffmpeg once and reads three things back:

- **Duplicated frames.** Frames that are near-copies of the one before them. This
  is what 24 fps material uploaded as 30 fps looks like — one frame in five is a
  repeat — and it is *not* the frozen-stretch flag: that one says nothing moved,
  this one says the same picture was delivered twice. A shot can be full of
  movement and full of duplicates at the same time.
- **Compression blocks.** The 8×8 macroblock grid showing through a hard squeeze.
  Nothing legitimate produces one: no camera, no lens, no lighting.
- **Blurred edges, at full size.** Edges that stay wide even in the shot's
  sharpest moments.

**That last one is the reason this pass exists**, because it is the one thing
nothing else in the app can see. The **Sharpness floor** above reads a Laplacian
computed on a 160-pixel-wide analysis copy — deliberately, since that measurement
over a full frame costs more than decoding it — and at 160 pixels, footage
upscaled from 480p and the genuine 1080p **are the same picture**. Measured on
three files carrying identical footage, the sharpness score read 354.35, 353.69
and 353.72 for native, 480p-upscaled and 320p-upscaled. Indistinguishable. This
pass reads the edges at full resolution instead and separates them.

It reads the *sharpest* tenth of each shot rather than the blurriest, and that is
on purpose: softness is sometimes a choice — a fast pan, a shallow depth of
field, a deliberate rack focus — so asking "is it soft even at its sharpest" is
the only form of the question that does not flag exactly the shots with the most
interesting movement.

Three cuts read the numbers: **Duplicated frames**, **Compression blocks** and
**Blurred edges**. Empty by default like everything else here, and applied at
read time, so moving one re-sorts the bank with nothing rescanned. **The block
score deserves one warning the others do not:** its absolute value depends on
what is in the frame nearly as much as on the damage — measured here, one scene
from a good encode to a ruined one moved from 13 to 43, while four *different*
scenes at one fixed quality spanned 1 to 25 000. Preview a value, look at what it
caught, move it. Do not carry a number over from somebody else's bank.

**Each file card now also shows how hard the file was squeezed** — its codec
profile, its bitrate, and *bits per pixel per frame*, which is the comparable one
(5 Mb/s is generous at 480p and starving at 4K). Roughly, under 0.05 is visibly
damaged and over 0.15 is comfortable. It is shown and never cut on, because it
only *predicts* the damage that the block score actually *measures* — and some
containers, MKV and WebM in particular, carry no bitrate at all, in which case
the line simply says less rather than inventing a number.

It is its own button, like 🔳 Safe zone and for the same reason: it consumes
nothing, so there is no order to protect. Two things are worth knowing before you
press it. It is the only reading pass that needs **ffmpeg** rather than the
decode extra — the video extra installs it, and without it this one button is
greyed with the reason in its tooltip while everything else keeps working. And it
costs real time: roughly **nine seconds per minute of 1080p source**, on the CPU,
never touching the GPU. A four-hour bank is a little over half an hour. Stopping
is safe and a re-run picks up at the first file it had not reached.

### 🤖 AI check — shots that may have been generated rather than filmed

Every pass above measures something the camera did. This one asks whether there
was a camera. A scrape in 2026 brings back generated clips mixed in with real
footage, and they are invisible at thumbnail size — a clean, well-lit,
well-framed synthetic clip passes the quality scan, the safe zone, the defect
sweep and the look score without a mark on it. It is worth finding: the published
curation work behind several open video models reports that even a small
minority of synthetic material in a corpus — under a tenth of it — measurably
degrades what a model trained on that corpus learns.

**🤖 AI check** decodes two contiguous seconds from the middle of each shot and
measures **how erratically the motion changes**. Not how much a shot moves — how
much the *rate* of movement varies from instant to instant. Real footage is full
of small irregularities: a hand shakes, a subject accelerates unevenly, light
flickers, the sensor is noisy. Generated footage, on the evidence the method was
built on, tends to be smoother than the world.

The number is stored per shot and read by one cut in **🎚 Quality cuts**,
**Motion irregularity floor** — the one threshold in the panel that works the
other way round from the rest. **A LOW score is the suspicious one**, so this is
a floor and raising it flags *more* shots; a shot below it wears a **May be
AI-generated** chip in the grid like any other flag. Set it as a \`_max\` in your
head and you will flag every handheld shot in the bank and clear every generated
one.

#### How much to trust it — read this before you use it

Not much, and the pass is built around saying so.

- **About three shots in four**, on material like yours. The SAFE Challenge
  evaluated AI-video detectors *blind*, on footage the entrants had never seen:
  the best system in the field scored **0.86** balanced accuracy on untouched
  video and **0.74** once that video had been post-processed. Re-compression
  alone moved AUC from 0.88 to 0.77. Anything scraped has been re-compressed by
  definition, so 0.74–0.75 is the honest figure — not the high nineties a
  detector's own paper reports on its own benchmark.
- **It has never been measured against a 2025-or-later generator.** The method
  was evaluated across forty subsets of 2023–24 output — ModelScope, Gen2, Pika,
  LaVie, Sora, CogVideoX, OpenSora and a dozen more. Its whole thesis is that
  *the generators of that moment* could not render second-order motion. That is
  exactly the kind of claim that decays, and nothing here says anything about
  Sora 2, Veo 3, Kling or Wan 2.5.
- **It is worst on the cheapest fakes.** On one generator whose output is
  incoherent and flickery, the reference implementation scores *below chance* —
  chaotic generation reads as *more* real than clean generation. Heavily
  stylised material and a hard cut inside the two-second window do the same
  thing.

So this is an **advisory** flag with a hedge built into its name. It ships with
no default, nothing in the app rejects or deletes a shot because of it, and the
chip says *may be*. Use it to decide what to look at, not what to throw away.

#### The mechanics

- Shots shorter than about **2.4 seconds** are not measured at all — the window
  needs sixteen frames at 8 fps plus a margin at each end so a dissolve never
  lands inside it. Those shots carry "too short" and no score, and they are
  never flagged. Re-running will not change that; re-cutting them would.
- **There is no value to type.** The method reports only rank metrics and its
  reference implementation contains no threshold anywhere, so no published
  number exists and nobody else's would transfer — the score's scale moves with
  the encoder and with the frame count. Use **Preview** against your own bank,
  look at what a value caught, move it.
- It runs on the **CPU**, deliberately, at roughly **0.8 seconds per shot** —
  about forty minutes for a three-thousand-shot bank. That is slower than the
  card would be, and it is the trade that lets you check a bank *while a
  training owns your GPU*. Stopping is safe; a re-run picks up where it left off.
- It needs the same **✨ Score interpreter** the look score uses, and downloads
  its encoder once on the first run.

#### It is not the same claim the image bank makes

The 🗃️ Bank already tells you whether a still is AI, and the two answers are
**different in kind**, which is why they are worded differently. The image
lane's \`AI\` verdict reads **metadata** — a generator's own prompt block inside
the PNG, an A1111 parameter string, a C2PA mark — and that is *proof* when it is
present. It is also absent from almost everything scraped, and its silence means
"unknown", never "not AI". This pass reads **the pixels** and infers, so it is
never proof and it is never silent. The image lane says *AI*; this one says *may
be*. Neither is evidence for the other.

### 🎥 Camera — what the camera did, as a label rather than a verdict

Every other pass on this page measures whether a shot is **good**. This one
measures what it **is**, and it never rejects anything. That is not politeness:
a video LoRA learns camera language along with the subject, and the two people
training on the same bank want opposite halves of it. One is building a
locked-off product shot and every wobble is contamination; the other is training
a handheld look, and the wobble *is* the target. So **🎥 Camera** labels, and you
decide which half you wanted.

Press it after the shots are cut. It tracks every frame of every shot — about
fifteen times real time on the CPU, so it can run while a training owns your card
— and stores the raw rates on each clip. The labels are worked out from those
rates when the gallery is drawn, so nothing is ever rescanned.

#### The labels

Eight of them are **the video trainer's own words**, not this app's. They come
from the vocabulary Hunyuan's camera classifier uses, which matters for one
practical reason: a label here will mean the same thing to the model you train
as it does to you.

| Label | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Pan left / right / up / down** | The frame moves across the scene in that direction. |
| **Zoom in / out** | The framing tightens or widens. |
| **Static shot** | Nothing moved enough to name — a tripod, a clamp, or very steady hands. |
| **Handheld** | The movement has a high-frequency part nobody is steering. |

Three more are **this app's own**, and the gallery marks them with a small \`ᐩ\` so
you never carry one into a caption expecting the trainer to recognise it:

| Label | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Rolling** \`ᐩ\` | The horizon turns — the camera rotates about its own axis. Absent from the trainer's fourteen, and measured here because it is the one movement a language model reading the footage reliably gets wrong. |
| **Slideshow** \`ᐩ\` | The whole frame moved as one rigid picture, which is what a photograph panned across does — a Ken Burns move, not a camera. |
| **Subject moves** \`ᐩ\` | Something in the shot moved more than the camera did, so no direction could be read at all. |

A shot carries **several** labels where several apply: a handheld pan that also
zooms is all three, and the filter row lets you pick any one of them.

#### Why there is no "tilt", and no orbit

You will look for **tilt up** and **tilt down**, because the trainer's vocabulary
has them and this app never shows them. They are missing on purpose. A camera
that **pivots** and a camera that **slides** put exactly the same movement on the
sensor — the difference between them is depth, and depth is not in a flat
picture. Rather than guess at a coin flip, everything in that family is reported
as **pan**, which is the honest superset.

**Around left / around right** are missing for the same reason, harder. An orbit
is a movement along an arc, and recovering it means reconstructing the scene in
three dimensions. The published benchmark for this (CameraBench, 2025) puts the
best geometric system at roughly **half** the answers correct, at *minutes* per
clip. So the choice is not between cheap and accurate — it is between fast and
expensive-but-still-a-coin-flip. Not offered.

#### When the reading cannot be trusted

The measurement finds the **dominant** motion in the frame. When a subject fills
enough of it, the dominant motion *is* the subject, and the result is a confident
description of a camera move that never happened — measured on a test clip whose
camera was a tripod and whose subject crossed a third of the frame, the raw fit
reported a brisk pan *and* a zoom.

So the pass checks how much of the frame its answer actually explains, and when
that falls too low it reports **Subject moves** and **no direction at all**. A
shot labelled that way is not a failure; it means the camera reading would have
been fiction, and the app would rather say nothing.

**One more honest limit.** *Slideshow* is detected by the frame moving as one
perfectly rigid picture, which is what a photograph does. A real pan across a
scene with **no depth** — a flat wall, a horizon, a distant skyline — has no
parallax either, and can land in the same bucket. If a shot you filmed yourself
is labelled a slideshow, that is why.

#### Filtering, and the one cut

The labels appear on each thumbnail (slate, bottom right — never amber, because
amber in this gallery means *a cut flagged this* and a pan is not a fault) and as
a **🎥 Camera** row of filters above the grid. It composes with the ⚑ flag chips,
so *"shaky shots that also pan right"* is one click each.

If you do want to **cut** on camera movement, 🎚 Quality cuts gains
**\`camera_shake_max\`**. It is empty by default like every other cut, and it is
deliberately **not** the same threshold as the *Handheld* label: the label fires
at a fixed internal floor and describes, the cut fires wherever you put it and
rejects. A shot can be labelled handheld without being flagged, or the reverse,
and both are correct.

### 🔗 Does each shot hold one scene — the cut the detector missed

Shot detection cuts on a change big enough to see. The ones it misses are the
soft changes — a dissolve, a match cut, a new angle inside the same room — and
what they leave behind is a "shot" that is really two. That clip is the worst
kind of training example: it teaches the model a transition nobody asked for, and
you cannot spot it by scrolling, because its thumbnail is one of its two halves
and looks perfectly fine.

**It runs by itself, at the end of 🔎 Find scenes, and costs nothing.** That pass
already embedded three frames of every shot. Comparing a shot's first frame to
its last is a handful of multiplications over numbers that are already on disk —
no decoding, no model, no button. A bank you embedded before this existed gets
its reading by clicking **🔎 Find scenes** again, and that click costs nothing for
the shots already embedded.

Each shot gains a **scene coherence** number: **1.00** means its first and last
frames are the same picture, and lower means the picture changed across the shot.
🎚 Quality cuts gains a **Scene coherence floor**, empty by default, that flags
anything below it as **Cut inside the shot**. The remedy is the next section:
open the shot and **✂ Split here**.

**How much to trust it — read this before you set the cut.** This is a *ranking*,
not a verdict. Measured on real footage, against shots of the same length, a cut
at **0.80** catches about a third of the genuinely double shots while flagging
about one honest shot in seven; **0.75** catches a fifth for one in ten. Use it to
decide which shots to *look* at first, and expect to keep some of what it flags.

**Why a long shot scores lower.** The number falls with elapsed time whether or
not anything was cut — a twenty-second locked-off take can read 0.84 with no cut
in it at all, simply because the light moved and people walked about. Short shots
score high for the opposite non-reason. If your bank is mostly long takes, set
the floor lower than the figures above suggest.

**What it is not.** A shot whose reading is near 1.00 is *not* flagged as still,
and this pass deliberately says nothing about stillness. The obvious other half
of the idea — "nothing changed, so nothing moved" — was measured against this
app's own motion readings and does not hold: the number tracks how *long* a shot
is far more than whether anything moves in it, and genuinely motionless shots
read no higher than ordinary ones. Stillness stays with **Barely moves**, which
reads the codec's own motion vectors, and with the **Slideshow** camera label,
which reads how rigidly the frame moves. Two measurements that look at the real
thing.

Shots with no vectors (you have not run 🔎 Find scenes) and shots **under a
second** — too short for the embed pass to take more than one frame — carry no
reading at all and are never flagged.

## Retouch a cut: trim, split, or draw a shot by hand

Shot detection is good and it is not right. It cuts a slow dissolve a second
early, and it happily hands back a shot whose last second is a frozen frame.
Before this panel existed the only gesture available on either was **✕ Reject** —
throwing away eight good seconds to be rid of one bad one.

Open any shot and unfold **✂ Trim & split this shot**, under the player:

- **Nudge either bound** by 1 s or by one frame. One frame means one frame *of
  your source file*, at its own rate — a 25 fps rush steps by 0.040 s, a 59.94 fps
  one by 0.017 s. The frame counts your target model wants are a different thing
  entirely, decided at build time.
- **⇤ playhead** snaps a bound to wherever the video is paused. Scrub to the frame
  you want, click, save.
- **✂ Split here** cuts the shot in two at the playhead. The half you were looking
  at keeps its triage decision, and so does the new one: split a *kept* shot and
  both halves stay kept, so you never have to find them again among hundreds.
- **＋ New shot from here** draws a shot the detector missed entirely. The player
  is pointed at the whole rush, so you can scrub anywhere in the file — not only
  inside the shot you opened — and mark a boundary that was never found.

**For image-to-video targets, the first frame is the conditioning image.** The
trainer conditions an i2v sample on the clip's *first* frame, so moving a start is
not trimming: it is choosing the exact picture the model learns to animate from.
If the first second of a shot is a dissolve, an i2v LoRA trained on it learns to
animate dissolves. The panel repeats this line where the buttons are.

**A re-cut shot loses its thumbnail and its quality scores, on purpose.** They
were measurements *of the old bounds* — a thumbnail showing a frame the shot no
longer contains is not stale, it is wrong. The tile goes blank and the bank's
next-step line offers **🖼 Make thumbnails** again; run it once when you are done
cutting rather than after every edit.

**Limits worth knowing.** A shot must last at least 0.5 s, and both halves of a
split must too — the buttons say so rather than silently clamping. Retouching is
refused while a pass is running on the bank (a thumbnail pass mid-edit would
produce a picture of the old span marked as current), so stop the pass first.
Re-detecting a file deletes the shots the detector drew and **never** the ones you
cut by hand; those stay, and may overlap the fresh ones. And editing a shot that
is already in a built dataset is allowed: the dataset stored its own copy of the
bounds when it was encoded, so nothing already on disk changes.

## Change how often a rush gets cut

Shot detection does not find cuts. It scores every frame — *how likely is a
transition here* — and the shot list is a **threshold** applied to that score
afterwards. The number that was applied for you is 0.5, which comes from the
detector's own paper, where it is never justified. It is a convention.

That mattered because disagreeing with it used to cost a full pass over the
file. It no longer does: the scores are kept next to the bank, so changing the
threshold and re-cutting an entire folder happens with no decoding and no GPU at
all. Unfold **🎬 Find shots — cut sensitivity** above the gallery.

- **👁 Preview** counts what each threshold would actually leave you — on *your*
  files, floor included — and says how each one differs from the value in force.
  "4 shots" means nothing on its own; "8 fewer than now" is a decision.
- **Save** stores the number and cuts nothing. **Save & re-cut this bank** does
  both, in seconds.
- **Leave the field empty to inherit** the app default. Empty is not zero — zero
  is a threshold that fires on every single frame and shatters a rush into
  hundreds of fragments.

**Which way to move it.** Higher cuts less often: fewer, longer shots, and far
fewer cuts invented inside footage that never had any. Lower catches the
boundaries a slow dissolve hides, and finds more of them everywhere else too. If
your folder is mostly single takes, 0.6–0.7 is the direction; if it is edited
material, stay at 0.5 or go under it. Nobody has measured the right answer for
amateur footage — that is exactly why the preview exists.

**One folder is rarely one kind of footage**, so a single file can carry its own
threshold and be re-cut on its own: **↻ Re-detect this file**, on the file's card
under **Files**.

### This file is one single take

Some rushes have no cuts at all, and the failure there is not a missed
boundary — it is a file quietly chopped into six fragments that each train on a
third of a gesture. **▣ Single shot**, on the file's card, replaces every shot of
that file with one covering the whole thing.

It sticks. The bank-wide re-cut and the detection pass both walk past a file
marked this way, and the card says **Single shot** so you can see why it never
changes. The way back is **↻ Re-detect this file** on that same card.

**↻ on a single file replaces hand-made cuts, and the bank-wide re-cut never
does.** That asymmetry is deliberate — it is what makes ↻ the way back from ▣ —
and both gestures ask before they act. Shots already promoted into a dataset are
kept in every case; the dataset stored its own copy of the bounds when it was
built.

### Cut, or dissolve

The detector produces a second output describing how *wide* each transition is,
which the app used to compute and discard. It is now read, and a shot whose
first or last frames are a cross-fade of its neighbour carries an amber
**dissolve 18f** chip on its tile — the frame count is the width of the fade.

No other tool in this space shows this, and it is worth knowing before you train
on a clip: a shot that opens on a cross-fade of another shot teaches a model to
open on a cross-fade. The chip is advisory, exactly like the quality flags — it
changes nothing about the cut, and the width-to-kind rule is a reading of how the
network was trained, not something anyone has measured on amateur footage.

**🎬 Find shots again is instant too, now.** Re-running the pass over a bank it
has already been through re-cuts from the stored scores instead of decoding
again, and the progress line says how many files it reused. It falls back to a
real pass for any file whose size on disk no longer matches what the scan
recorded — you re-exported it, so its old boundaries describe footage that is not
there any more.

**Two limits worth saying out loud.** A file detected before this shipped has no
stored scores, so it cannot be re-cut instantly — the panel says so and offers
🎬 Find shots, which fills them in on the way past. And a re-cut replaces shots,
so the replaced ones lose their thumbnails and quality scores: those measured
bounds that no longer exist. Run 🖼 Make thumbnails once when you are done
cutting, not after every change.

## Find scenes in a video bank by typing a word

A folder of rushes is a haystack whose needles have no names. The quality cuts
tell you which shots are sharp and which move; they cannot tell you which one has
the red car in it. **🔎 Find scenes** does: type *a woman walking on a beach* and
the gallery is replaced by the shots that look most like it, best first.

**Run the pass once, search as often as you like.** The 🔎 Find scenes button
looks at a few frames of every shot and remembers what they look like. It is the
slow part — it needs the same environment as the image bank's ✨ Score (Setup ▸
Quality tools, or a Python you already have with torch and open_clip), and on a
CPU it is minutes rather than seconds. Every search afterwards is instant and
costs nothing.

**Several frames per shot, not one.** A shot is a span of time, and a thumbnail is
one instant of it. If a car only drives into view in the last second, a search
that had looked at the opening frame would never find that shot — and would give
you no hint that it had missed it. So each shot contributes a frame near its
start, its sharpest frame, and one near its end, and a shot's score is the best of
the three. Every result tells you **which second matched**, and opening it starts
the player right there.

**It is a ranking, not a filter.** Every shot scores something against every
phrase, so the results always come back full, however wrong the query. The line
above the gallery says how strong the top and bottom of the ranking are, and how
many shots could not be searched at all — a shot the pass has not reached cannot
be found by any phrase, and it would be easy to conclude the scene simply is not
in the bank.

**What it cannot do**, measured on the model this app uses:

- **“Without” is ignored, not honoured.** Ask for *a street without cars* and you
  get cars. Type \`-cars\` instead: that subtracts the unwanted thing from the score
  and pushes those shots down the ranking. It cannot promise their absence, and
  the panel says so rather than pretending otherwise.
- **It cannot count.** *Two people* barely outranks a picture of one.
- **It cannot hear, and it cannot see motion.** Only still frames are looked at,
  so *a door slamming* or *panning left* describe nothing it can use.
- **Left and right carry almost no meaning.**

Searching respects the triage filter you are on, so *keep only* plus a phrase
ranks what you already decided to keep. Changing the filter clears the search: a
ranking computed over one bucket has nothing to say about another.

## Describe your shots, and search what happens in them

🔎 Find scenes ranks by what a moment **looks like**. It cannot find an action —
"turns and walks away" is a fact about *time*, and no single frame carries it. The
**🗣 Describe shots** pass closes that gap: it watches eight frames spread across
each shot and writes one or two sentences about what happens in it.

That line does two jobs, and the second is the one nobody sees coming:

- **It is what the clip trains on.** At promotion each clip gets a \`.txt\` sidecar
  next to it, and that file *is* the prompt. Before this pass existed every
  promoted clip shipped with an **empty** one — which the trainer accepts in
  silence, training the clip on no prompt at all. The build dialog now tells you
  how many clips are about to go out uncaptioned, before it encodes anything.
- **It makes the search read words as well as pixels.** Once captions exist,
  typing a phrase ranks on both, and the panel says which halves are running so
  that "nothing found" can be read correctly.

**Captions are drafts.** Open any shot and edit the caption under the player; a
bulk re-run will never overwrite one you wrote. Clearing it puts the shot back in
the queue. Regenerating over your own words is possible, but you have to ask for
it by name.

**You can change how plainly they are written.** Next to the button there is a
**Caption wording** choice: *Standard* (the shipped wording) or *Plain*, which
gives the model explicit permission to name what is on screen instead of
describing around it. On adult footage that difference is not cosmetic — a
captioner asked the standard way produces captions that are *about something
other than the shot*, and a LoRA trained on those learns the evasion. It was
measured rather than assumed: the wording turned out to matter **more than the
model**, and the stock model asked plainly beat an uncensored one asked the old
way. Every caption records which wording produced it, and the choice is
remembered as \`video_caption.style\` if you set it in your config.

**You can change which model writes them.** The pass ships with one checkpoint
and uses it unless you say otherwise (\`video_caption.model\` — see *Settings
reference*). It is worth changing when the default **talks around** what your
footage shows: a caption that names things evasively is not a style choice, it
teaches the trained model to look away too, and the captions read perfectly well
while being about something slightly other than the shot. Any checkpoint of the
same architecture is a drop-in. If it is not on your machine, the first run
downloads it — and the pass says so in its progress line before captioning
anything, rather than sitting at 0 % while gigabytes arrive. Every caption
records which model wrote it, so a bank captioned across a change stays readable.

**It needs the same environment as ✨ Score** (torch + transformers) and it uses
the GPU when there is one — a 4B vision model on a CPU is minutes per shot. It
will not start while a training run owns the card, and stopping is safe: what is
captioned stays captioned and the next run picks up where it left off.

## Video training sets (and the two things to check before you cut one)

Promoting a video bank builds a flat folder of clips with a \`.txt\` caption next
to each one, and lists it in your library under **🎬 Video training sets**.

**You can cap how many clips one source contributes.** A 50-clip set that is
three videos over-represented looks exactly like a diverse one on disk, and that
imbalance is the kind that quietly overfits a source. **Max clips per source**
caps it; leave it empty for no cap. The cap trims dominance without punishing
scarcity — a file with fewer clips than the cap keeps all of them — and it is
**not a random sample**: each source keeps its earliest clips, so promoting the
same bank twice gives you the same dataset. When a finished set leans on one file
anyway, the result tells you the real share.

**You can trim the edges of every clip.** A shot boundary is where a cut just
happened, so the first and last frames of a shot are disproportionately
dissolves, fades and leftovers of a transition — and a dataset whose clips all
open on half a dissolve teaches the model to open on half a dissolve. **Trim each
end** takes a number of seconds off *both* bounds; 0.25 is the common figure, and
the default is 0 so an existing recipe exports exactly what it exported before.

The trim never shortens a clip. Frame counts are a property of the target's VAE,
so a clip that no longer supplies the count is **dropped, not exported short** —
ffmpeg would write the short file and exit 0, and ai-toolkit would train it as
repeated stills without a word. The dialog says how many clips the trim will cost
*before* you press the button, and those are counted separately from clips that
were never long enough: only the first kind is fixed by lowering the trim.

**The clip length is chosen in FRAMES, from a menu.** That is not pedantry: the
legal frame counts are a property of each model's VAE, not of video. 29 frames is
legal for Wan and illegal for LTX; MiniMax H3 wants counts of the form 17n+5. No
trainer refuses an illegal count — they round it down in latent space and say
nothing. So the menu offers only counts the target can actually ingest, with the
duration shown next to each at that model's own frame rate.

Two labels sit next to every target, and both are there to save a wasted week:

- **Not trainable yet** — the app knows the model's geometry perfectly and no
  LoRA trainer for it is known to exist. Exactly one target of the four currently
  clears that bar (Wan 2.1 / 2.2 14B). You can still cut a dataset for the
  others; just know that today nothing is known to train on it.
- **Licence limits** — MiniMax H3's Community Licence grants rights **only**
  inside an "Applicable Territory" that excludes the EU, the UK, South Korea and
  the USA. The restriction covers the **outputs**, not just the model, so keeping
  your training private is not a way around it. Check your territory before you
  build the set, not after.

Deleting a video dataset deletes the encoded clips and nothing else: the bank
keeps every shot and every decision, so you can re-cut at another length or for
another target without triaging again.

## Stopping Score, and what a relaunch costs

**✨ Score** always covers the whole bank — but it only *computes* what it does
not already have. Every image it scores is written to a cache next to the bank
(the CLIP embedding plus the aesthetic and NSFW numbers), and a relaunch reads
that cache and pays only for the rest. On a bank that is fully scored, the pass
does not even load the model: it goes straight to the grouping.

So **Stop is safe**, and it is now safe in the database too. When you stop a run,
the scores it had already computed are written to your images before the pass
ends — that work was paid for, and it used to reach the cache and never reach a
single row. The line at the end of the pass says exactly what happened: how many
images were scored, how many remain, and how many were reused instead of
recomputed.

One thing does *not* survive a stop: the **🎨 style groups**. Those ids are not a
per-image measurement, they are a single numbering of the whole bank, computed
from every embedding at once and renumbered on each pass. Half of one is not
partial progress — it would put a new group 1 next to an old group 1 and mix two
unrelated styles under the same chip. So a stopped pass leaves the previous
grouping alone and says so. Relaunch and it finishes: the scoring part is already
cached, and only the grouping is left. That grouping is the slow tail of the pass
— about **8 seconds over 5 000 images and 3 minutes over 23 000** — so on a big
bank it is worth letting it finish.

**Rescore all** is the last line of ✨ Score's launch window, unticked. It is the
opposite intent: throw the cache away and recompute everything, for a bank you
scored with a different setup or whose results you no longer trust. It costs a
full pass, which is why it is a deliberate tick and never a default — ✨ Score
itself has always meant "cover the whole bank", and it still does.

One more thing a relaunch fixes on its own: if the aesthetic head or the NSFW
model could not be downloaded during an earlier run, the images scored in that
window carry a hole. They are picked up again the next time you run Score, once
the missing piece is available — an image is never left permanently half-scored
because a download failed once.

## The LoRA Canvas (every run on one board)

**Canvas** in the top bar opens a single board holding the training history of
every dataset you have. Each dataset gets a lane; inside a lane, each run is a
card and each save it wrote is a small pill underneath it. When a run continued
from an earlier one, the line between them starts at the *exact* checkpoint it
resumed from — so "where did this LoRA come from" is a thing you read, not a
thing you reconstruct.

**Choosing what is on the board.** Everything is on it by default. Above the
board sits a single row of filter chips, about 40 px tall — it used to be a
fold-out panel, and unfolded on a library of fourteen datasets it stood 389 px
on a 720-px screen, more than half the window, directly above the thing you came
to look at.

- **Datasets** opens a menu with a search box, **Select all** / **Clear**, and
  one checkbox per dataset with its run count. The search matches the name *and*
  the model family, so typing \`krea\` brings up every Krea lane.
- **Models** and **Status** are the same idea for the model family and the run
  state (Active, Completed, Errors, Unknown).
- **Pinned** toggles the pinned images on and off. Turned off it goes amber:
  pinned pictures missing from the board with no visible cause is a bug report
  waiting to happen.
- The **search box** stays at full size in the row — it filters the *runs* on the
  board (dataset, run ID, model, variant), which is a different question from
  "find me a lane to tick".
- **Reset** puts everything back, and goes dim when there is nothing to reset.

Every chip carries its own count and lights up while it is narrowing something,
and the row ends with **N runs shown** — so a filter you set and forgot can never
empty your board without saying why. Your choices are remembered between visits.

**Saving an arrangement.** **💾 Layouts** in the board toolbar keeps where every
run card and every pinned picture sits, under a name, and puts it back later —
closed pictures included. Until this existed, the only way out of an arrangement
was **✦ Tidy up**, which throws it away. A run deleted since the layout was saved
simply is not restored, and the app tells you how many were missing rather than
leaving you to hunt for the card that did not come back.

**Exporting the board.** **📷 PNG** writes the whole canvas to one image file:
every pinned picture at full size, every run card with its checkpoints, and the
lines that join them. It is a redraw rather than a screenshot, so the buttons,
badges and hover highlights are not in it — and a picture whose file has been
cleaned off the disk comes out as a labelled placeholder rather than silently
missing.

**Machine load.** The right-hand end of the board toolbar carries five small
numbers for the machine *running LDS* — **CPU**, **GPU**, **VRAM**, **RAM** and
the GPU **temperature** — refreshed every five seconds while the tab is in
front. It answers the one question the board could not: whether a run that
shows no new pictures is working or wedged. Every number carries a colour:
green below 50 % of its resource, amber 50-80 %, red past 80 % (for the
temperature: amber from 70°, red from 85°, the band where a GPU starts
throttling); **▾** folds the readout away and stops the polling with it, and
the choice is remembered. It is a glance, not a monitor: there is no history,
no graph and no per-process breakdown. On a machine with no NVIDIA card (or
with \`nvidia-smi\` unavailable, as in some containers) the GPU, VRAM and
temperature numbers are simply absent rather than shown as zeros. On a phone
the readout rides in the board's **⋯** shelf rather than the toolbar.

The same readout is available on *every* page: the **📊** button at the right
of the top bar (in the menu panel, on a phone) unfolds an identical line next
to the navigation, so you can watch a training or a generation work from the
Test Studio, the Bank or a dataset without keeping Task Manager — or a ComfyUI
resource monitor — open. It starts folded, polls only while it is unfolded and
the tab is visible, and remembers your choice separately from the board's.

**Deleting a picture from the board.** A pinned image carries **✕** and **🗑**,
and they are not the same thing. **✕** takes it off the board and remembers where
it was, so re-pinning it from its gallery puts it back at the same spot and size.
**🗑** deletes the image itself, through the same route (and the same
recoverable-or-not setting) the gallery's own delete uses; it arms on the first
press and deletes on the second, because a delete one tap away from ✕ on a small
control is a delete that happens by accident.

**Zoomed out.** Below 55 % zoom each run card carries its run number at a
constant, readable size, and below 30 % the dataset name comes with it. A board
of a dozen lanes is read at 30-40 %, where a card's own title is about four
pixels tall.

**Moving around.** Drag the background to pan, use the wheel (or two fingers) to
zoom, and **Fit** puts the whole board back in view. The board only fits itself
automatically until you first touch it — after that a dataset finishing its load
never yanks your view away.

**Moving something counts as touching it.** Zooming and panning are not the only
way to take the view over: the first time you drag a picture or a run card to a
new place, the board stops re-framing itself for good. Placing a render far from
its lane makes the board bigger, and an automatic fit at that moment zoomed the
whole plateau out the instant you let go — your framing thrown away by the very
act of tidying. **✦ Fit** is still one click away whenever you *do* want the
whole board back; it simply is not decided for you any more. A board you have
never arranged still opens fitted, as it always did.

**The reference face.** A character dataset's lane opens with its reference
image, next to the dataset name — the person the renders on that lane are meant
to be. Click it to open it full size against them. It is part of the lane label,
not a pinned picture: it cannot be moved, closed, grouped or exported. Concept
and style datasets show nothing there, because they are not built around a
reference face.

**Reading a run.** Click a run card to open **everything that run produced**:
its images grouped by the checkpoint that made them, most-trained step first, so
you can see where the LoRA stopped getting better without opening one pill at a
time. Underneath the images are the run's note, its per-checkpoint notes, and the
settings it trained with. **ⓘ Full details** opens the drawer where those notes
can be edited.

A run with many checkpoints opens with its three most-trained steps expanded and
the rest folded behind their image counts — tap a step to unfold it. When a run
holds more images than one panel should carry, the panel says so rather than
looking complete; the missing ones are still reachable from each checkpoint's own
pill and in the Test Studio.

Sometimes a step reads **Step unknown**. Those are older test images whose file
name identifies the run but not the checkpoint inside it, so they belong to the
run and to no pill. Images that identify nothing at all are still counted in the
footnote at the bottom of the panel — they live in the Test Studio.

**Shift-click two** run cards to compare their settings side by side, with the
differences highlighted — and because every dataset is on the same board, those
two runs no longer have to belong to the same dataset. Dragging a card to
rearrange the board never opens the panel.

**Arranging the board.** Drag a run card and it stays where you put it, across
reloads. On a phone, moving a card and scrolling the board are the same gesture,
so a card is picked up with a **long press** — rest your finger on it for a
moment and it lifts; a finger that slides straight away scrolls as usual.

Once you have moved anything in a lane, that whole lane stops rearranging itself:
a training run that finishes later lands in free space next to your layout
instead of pushing everything sideways, which is what would otherwise happen —
the automatic tree centres each run over its continuations, so one new branch
re-flows the lane around it. Lanes you have never touched keep following the
automatic tree, because there is no arrangement to protect there.

**✦ Tidy up** is the way back: it forgets every card you have moved on the lanes
currently shown, rebuilds the automatic tree, and brings every pinned picture
back beside the run that made it — including one you dragged clean off its lane.
Positions are only ever a display preference — moving a card or a picture never
changes which run continued which or which checkpoint made which image, and Tidy
up never deletes a run, a checkpoint, a note or a picture.

**Generating from the board.** Every checkpoint pill carries a small **✓** box.
Tick one and the run settings open beside the board: the prompt, the seed, the
format, the steps, the engine settings — the Test Studio's own panel, not a
lookalike, so anything the Test Studio can do the board can do too.

What the board adds is that your picks do not have to belong to the same
dataset. Tick a checkpoint in one lane and two in another and they run together
on one shared prompt and one shared seed, which is the only honest way to
compare LoRAs against each other.

Two things it will tell you rather than fail at:

- **A checkpoint that is not in ComfyUI yet** is still pickable. The button then
  says what it is about to do — *"Deploy 2 checkpoints, then generate"* — and
  waits for you. Nothing is copied into your ComfyUI folder by a button that did
  not announce it, and if a copy fails, nothing generates: half a comparison
  answers a different question than the one you asked.
- **Two different families in one selection** (say Krea and Z-Image) is refused,
  and it says which two. This is not a restriction we chose: those families do
  not share a base model or a workflow, so there is no single run that can render
  both. Unpick one family and the button comes back.

**⚖ Compare or 🧬 Blend.** From the second pick onwards the panel offers a
choice, and it defaults to what it always did:

- **⚖ Compare** — one pass per checkpoint, swept across the strengths. This is
  how you find out which LoRA, or which step, is better.
- **🧬 Blend** — *one* generation loads them **all**, each at its own weight, and
  every dataset's trigger word is added to the front of your prompt. The panel
  lists those words before you launch; nothing is injected silently. It is the
  Test Studio's Blend mode, driven from the board — the same toggle, the same
  engine. (The Test Studio called it **🧬 Combine** until August 2026; only the
  name changed.)

A blend is one configuration, not one per pick, so the strength sweep disappears
(each LoRA carries its own weight instead) and the image counter drops to one
picture per seed.

**Trying several weights at once.** Each picked checkpoint has a row of weight
boxes under its slider. Tick two on one and two on another, and the launch
renders **all four combinations** in a single run instead of making you launch,
look, move a slider and launch again. Every image is labelled with the pair that
produced it. Tick nothing and the slider governs, exactly as before; the slider
is also how you use a weight that is not on the grid.

The panel counts the cost before you commit — "4 weight combinations → 4 images,
about 1 min" — and turns amber past 24 images. It does not refuse: the queue is
serial and the machine is yours. Two checkpoints at four weights each is 16
images, which is exactly why the panel does the multiplication for you.

What blending actually does is worth saying plainly: **two identity LoRAs give
you a hybrid person** — someone who is neither of the two. That is a real use, on
purpose, but it is not "both people in one shot". The combination that usually
pays off is **identity + style**, or **identity + concept**. Weights are the dial:
below 1 the LoRA contributes less, above 1 it dominates (0 to 2, 1 by default),
and a weight you set survives un-ticking another pick or reloading the page.

Blend needs **at least two checkpoints of one family**; with a mixed selection
the toggle is greyed out with the reason, because the run underneath it could not
exist either. Picks that are not deployed yet are deployed first, all of them,
before anything is generated — a blend never loads a subset of what it announced.

**▶ Continue training from a checkpoint.** Clicking a pill's body opens its
actions — Download, Deploy, Details, Delete — and **▶ Continue from here**. It
opens the *same* launch dialog the Checkpoints panel and the Runs page open, on
*that exact save*: how many
extra steps, and — folded under *Adjust settings* — the checkpoint cadence, the
preview prompts, the preview steps and CFG, the timestep weighting and the
learning rate. Rank, base and
optimizer are locked to the checkpoint being continued; they are not things a
resume can change.

The dialog also names **what “resume” means**; it never silently guesses:

- **Full training state** is offered only for a local checkpoint carrying a
  complete, hash-verified state bundle. It restores the raw adapter parameters,
  optimizer, scheduler, scaler, EMA, Python/NumPy/Torch/CUDA random generators,
  dataloader order and cursor, bucket/crop geometry, the exact latent/text-cache
  bytes, and the exact next step. Exported image, caption and mask contents,
  dataset topology, base, network shape, training recipe, ai-toolkit revision,
  GPU identity and the complete installed Python-package map must still match.
  In this mode only the preview settings can change — the prompts, and the
  preview **steps and CFG**: those decide how a test image is rendered once the
  sampler is already running, and touch neither the loop nor the weights.
  Save/preview cadence, learning rate and timestep weighting stay locked because
  changing any of them would change the trajectory the state belongs to.
- **LoRA weights only** is the explicit fallback and is available for legacy
  checkpoints. The chosen \`.safetensors\` is copied into a clean run folder;
  optimizer, scheduler, scaler, RNG and dataloader progress restart. The source
  run is renamed aside, not deleted, so all its saves remain recoverable.

Each checkpoint says why full state is unavailable when its bundle is missing,
incomplete, corrupt or incompatible. State bundles are published atomically and the newest two are retained alongside
the public checkpoints, so a crash during capture cannot masquerade as a usable
exact save.

One deliberately conservative boundary remains: low-level Torch/CUDA backend
flags changed externally after LDS performs its runtime preflight are not yet
part of the compatibility fingerprint. Do not change deterministic/TF32/cuDNN
flags between the original process and an exact continuation.

Read the step field as **extra** steps, not a total: the line beside it spells
out where you land ("→ target step 3500") and so does the button. Resuming step
2500 of a run that ended at 3500 is the whole point of opening this from a pill
— a later epoch can be over-cooked, and the earlier one is often the better
LoRA.

What is *not* possible is stated rather than hidden — a lane you cannot use
stays visible, greyed, with its reason:

- *"Local training needs ai-toolkit"* / *"A training is already running on this
  machine"* — local training is single-flight for the whole machine.
- *"Cloud training needs a rental key set up in Settings"* — **this build trains
  locally only**, so the cloud lane is always closed here, on this board exactly
  as in the dataset's own Continue dialog. It is shown rather than removed so the
  two screens never disagree about why an option is unavailable.
- *"This save is no longer on this machine"* — there is no copy anywhere, so the
  lane that needs the file says so instead of failing at launch.

If the save vanished between the board being drawn and the click, the launch is
refused with the steps that *are* available, named — never a silent failure.

**The gallery under a checkpoint.** Images pile up. A checkpoint that has
produced more than one shows a small **× N** badge; clicking it opens everything
that checkpoint ever made, newest first — from the board, from the Test Studio,
from a comparison run, it does not matter. Regenerating no longer replaces what
was there.

Which image belongs to which checkpoint is recorded when the image is generated.
Images made before that was recorded are matched back where the evidence allows
it (the run tag the deploy stamps into the LoRA's name); those that cannot be
traced are **counted and left out** rather than shown under a checkpoint they
might not belong to. The gallery says how many those are — they are still in the
Test Studio, they simply have no node to sit under.

**What a generated image was made with.** Open any image from a gallery and the
full-screen view lays its record out beside it: the three facts you look for
first (**step**, **seed**, **LoRA strength**) as chips, then the settings that
actually decided the picture — sampler, scheduler, CFG, sampling steps, the base
model, the LoRA file, any always-on LoRAs, the format, the face-similarity score
— and the prompt last. The prompt folds when it is long instead of pushing
everything else off the screen, and both the **seed** and the **prompt** copy in
one click. A run that predates a given setting simply shows no row for it: an
absent line is honest, a dash is not.

**📌 Pinning an image onto the board.** Comparing two checkpoints means looking
at their pictures *at the same time*, which a full-screen viewer cannot do. From
that viewer, **Pin to canvas** drops the image onto the board as a node of its
own, joined to the checkpoint that produced it by the same connector the board
uses for "this run continued from that checkpoint".
**📌 Pinning an image onto the board.** Comparing two checkpoints means looking
at their pictures *at the same time*, which a full-screen viewer cannot do. So
**📌** drops an image onto the board as a node of its own, joined to the
checkpoint that produced it by the same connector the board uses for "this run
continued from that checkpoint".

There are two ways in, and the first one is the one to remember: **every
thumbnail in a run or checkpoint gallery carries a 📌 in its bottom-right
corner** — one tap, no need to open the image at all. It is hidden while you are
in **Select** mode (that mode is for arming a delete, and a second target there
is a mis-tap waiting to happen). The same action is also in the full-screen
viewer, spelled out as **📌 Pin to canvas**, for when you have already opened a
picture and decide it belongs on the board.

- **Move it** by dragging (on a phone: a long press picks it up, exactly like a
  run card). **Resize it** from the corner handle. **Close it** with **✕**.
- **It goes wherever you want on the board — its lane is not a box.** Drag it
  above its own lane, into the margin to the left of everything, or across to sit
  beside another dataset's runs: nothing stops at the lane's corner any more, and
  the arrow keys reach the same places. **✦ Fit** grows to include it, so a
  picture parked well outside its lane is always one click from being back on
  screen. Two things stay true wherever you put it: the line to the checkpoint
  that made it follows it (that link is read off the image, never off its
  position, so a picture can never end up claiming a run it did not come from),
  and the picture still belongs to its own dataset — moving it over another
  lane's runs changes nothing but where it is drawn.
- The one thing to know before parking one far away: a lane's own position on the
  board depends on which datasets are ticked and how tall the lanes above it are.
  A picture is measured from **its own lane**, so it travels with the run it is
  evidence about — put it next to *another* dataset's lane and it will keep that
  spot relative to its own lane, not relative to its neighbour. **✦ Tidy up**
  brings everything home if a board gets away from you.
- Closing forgets nothing. Pin the same image again and it comes back **exactly
  where you left it, at exactly the size you left it** — that is the point of the
  feature, not a side effect. The geometry lives with your card positions, on
  your machine's LoRA Dataset Studio rather than in one browser, so it follows
  the dataset.
- **Keyboard:** focus a pinned image (Tab), then the arrow keys move it,
  Shift+arrows move it faster, **+** / **−** resize it and **Esc** closes it.
- If the image is later **deleted**, its node quietly leaves the board — a node
  showing a picture that no longer exists would be worse than no node. If the
  *checkpoint* is gone but the image is not, the picture stays and simply loses
  its connecting line.
- Unticking a dataset takes its lane off the board, pinned images included; they
  come back with the lane, untouched.
- **✦ Tidy up** does not throw pinned images away — it brings them **home**. Every
  picture on the visible board comes back beside the run that made it, into the
  same tidy band **📌 Pin all** uses, wherever you had dragged it to. That is the
  guaranteed way back from a picture parked far outside its lane, and it is why
  free placement is safe to play with. Pictures you have **closed** are not
  touched: their remembered spot is a promise, and Tidy up is not the place to
  break it.
- The **✕**, the **🔍** and the resize corner keep a finger-sized target **at
  every zoom level**: they are drawn at a constant size on screen rather than at
  the board's, so a board fitted to twenty runs is still one you can tap.

**🖼🖼 Fuse pinned images side by side.** Comparing two renders across a gap and
two frames is comparing two frames. **Drop one pinned image onto another and
they become a single node**, pictures edge to edge with nothing drawn between
them. There is **no limit**: drop a third, a tenth, they all join the strip.

- **Where it lands.** While you drag, the picture you are about to join lights up
  with a dashed outline, a bar marks the exact slot yours would take, and a label
  says how many pictures the group would then hold. Let go anywhere else and it
  is an ordinary move — nothing fuses by surprise.
- **Which side.** Drop on the left half of a picture to land before it, on the
  right half to land after it. The same gesture **re-orders** a group: drag a
  member out and back onto the slot you want.
- **Move the whole group** by its **title bar** (\`⠿ N images\`), which is also
  where its **✕** lives. That bar is the only thing that moves a group, on
  purpose: dragging a *picture* inside a group means something else entirely.
- **Take one back out** by dragging it **off the group**. That is the whole rule
  — while it is still over the strip nothing has happened, and letting go there
  puts it back. Once it is clear of the strip it becomes a node of its own again,
  **at the size it had before it joined**, wherever you dropped it. Joining a
  group never rewrites a picture's own size; the strip only borrows it.
- **The pictures that stay do not move.** Take the first one out and the strip
  keeps its place and its height; the rest simply close the gap. A group left
  with a single picture stops being a group.
- **Which ✕ am I about to press?** At rest a group is nothing but photographs.
  Hover (or Tab to) one and *that* picture lights up and shows its own step
  label, its and its ✕ — the group's own ✕ is the one on the title bar, and it
  carries the count (\`✕3\`) precisely so the two can never be confused. Closing a
  group closes all of its pictures, undoes the group, and each one keeps its own
  remembered size; re-pinning one from its gallery brings back **that one**, not
  the strip.
- **Every picture in a strip is the same height**, each scaled to keep its own
  shape — that is what makes the band continuous instead of a row of letterboxed
  tiles. Resize the group from its corner and the whole strip scales.
- **A strip gets ONE link back to each checkpoint it came from**, not one per
  picture, and they all leave the band at the same point. A strip is one object
  to the eye and to every gesture, so eight connectors fanning out of it was
  eight times the ink for one fact — and now that a picture can be parked far
  from its run, those links are long. A strip whose pictures all come from the
  same checkpoint therefore draws a single line; one built from three epochs
  draws three, because collapsing them would quietly credit one epoch with the
  other two.
- **A strip has no width limit, and that is the honest consequence of "no
  limit".** Ten pictures side by side is ten times as wide as one; the board
  zooms and pans, so **✦ Fit** is the answer. It deliberately does *not* wrap
  onto a second row — a strip that quietly stopped being a strip at some
  invisible threshold would be worse than a wide one. On a phone, expect to zoom.
- **✦ Tidy up moves a strip, and never takes one apart.** It brings the whole
  band back beside the run that made its first picture, in one piece and in the
  same order — a strip is something you assembled on purpose, so tidying it means
  putting it away, not dismantling it. (It used to leave strips exactly where
  they were, which was fine while a strip could not leave its lane; now that one
  can be parked anywhere on the board, "leave it alone" would have meant leaving
  it lost.) The way *out* of a group is still the group's ✕, or dragging its
  pictures back off it.

**📌 Pin all — the whole lot in one gesture.** When a generation launched from
the board finishes, the green bar says how many images are ready and names the
checkpoints they joined. **📌 Pin all N to the board** puts every one of them on
the board without opening a single gallery.

- **Where they land.** In a band under the lane, **one column per checkpoint**,
  each column under the checkpoint that produced it — so a lot spanning four runs
  reads as four groups, and each picture still draws its own line back to its
  pill. The band starts below everything already on the lane, which is what makes
  the guarantee a real one: **nothing is ever placed on top of a run card, a
  checkpoint pill or a picture you positioned yourself.**
- **One strip per generation, always in training order.** The pictures of one
  run fuse into a single strip that reads left to right by step — 500, 1000,
  1500 — so the strip is an epoch axis. A **second** generation, even fired at
  the same checkpoint, gets its **own** strip: two runs stay two runs on the
  board, which is the only way to compare them. Pinning one picture at a time
  from a gallery follows the same rule — it joins the strip of the generation it
  came from, in its place in the order, never the end. Images generated before
  LDS recorded which launch made them fall back to grouping by checkpoint.
- **Big lots become a contact sheet.** A pair of renders lands full size; twenty
  or thirty land as thumbnails, which is the size you actually compare that many
  pictures at. Each one is still resizable afterwards like any other node.
- **What is already on the board is left alone.** An image you have already
  pinned is neither moved nor duplicated, and the button counts only what is
  left — once everything is up, the button is simply not there any more. An
  image you *closed* is offered again, and comes back where you closed it when
  that spot is free.
- **Nothing is stacked in silence.** One click places at most 40 pictures; if the
  run made more, the bar says how many were left out and where to get them
  (their checkpoint gallery). The count of what was actually pinned is announced
  for screen readers too.
- **↩ Undo** takes exactly the images that click added straight back off the
  board, and nothing else.

**Which checkpoints you can generate from, at a glance.** Every checkpoint pill
carries its deployment state on its **left edge**: a **solid sky bar** means the
checkpoint is deployed to ComfyUI and can be generated from right now; a **dashed
grey bar** means the file is on your disk but not deployed yet. Not deployed does
*not* mean missing — the save is there, it simply has no copy in ComfyUI, and
ticking it before **🎨 Generate** makes the launch deploy it for you. The shape
(solid versus dashed) carries as much of the message as the colour does, a legend
sits above the board, and hovering a pill spells it out in words.

The graph embedded in a dataset's *Checkpoints & LoRAs* panel is unchanged and
still holds the per-checkpoint actions (download, deploy, continue from here,
inline previews). The canvas is a second way in, not a replacement.

## Undeploy several LoRAs at once

Deploying a checkpoint copies it into ComfyUI's \`loras\` folder so you can use it
in a workflow. Over a few months of training that folder fills up, and taking
LoRAs back out used to be a one-at-a-time errand: open a run's checkpoint pill,
open its popover, press ⏏ Undeploy, repeat. Nothing anywhere even told you how
many were deployed.

**⏏ Undeploy…** at the top of the **Canvas** page opens the whole list at once —
every LoRA this app has put into ComfyUI, across *all* your datasets and all
families, grouped by dataset. Tick the ones you want gone, press the button, and
they go in one pass. **Select all** is there for the clear-out.

**Only what the app deployed is listed.** A LoRA you downloaded yourself and
dropped in the same folder never appears, and is never touched — the list is
built from the app's own record of what it imported, not from a directory scan.
That distinction matters because this screen deletes files.

**It is the reversible half.** Your *training saves* are kept: every LoRA you
undeploy can be deployed again from its checkpoint whenever you want. The
removed copies go to the trash, recoverable until you empty it in
**Settings ▸ Maintenance**.

The run reports what it actually did, in three parts, because they are not the
same thing: how many were **removed**, how many were **already gone** (you had
deleted the file by hand — no error, you have the outcome you asked for), and how
many were **refused**, each named so you can act on it.

## Upscale a picture straight from the board

Click a pinned picture (🔍, or the picture itself) and the full-screen view now
carries **✨ Upscale & improve** next to **⬇ Download** — the same pass, and the
same choice of engine, as the one in the dataset lightbox.

The same button is on the **checkpoint and run galleries** — open a picture from
a pill's 🖼 gallery, or from a run card, and it is there too. That is where an
improvement is delivered, so it is where the gesture costs the fewest clicks:
you are already comparing a checkpoint's renders when you decide one of them
deserves a bigger pass. Both surfaces are the same action on the same picture:

- **✨ Improve via Klein** re-renders detail and texture. Sharper, but skin and
  colour can shift. The note under the button quotes the exact instruction it is
  about to send and links to where you can edit it or switch it off.
- **🔍 Upscale via SeedVR2** resolves detail at a higher resolution and keeps the
  original look. It appears once SeedVR2 is installed; until then Setup ▸ ComfyUI
  can download it for you, and pressing ✨ before that answers with the same
  offer to install it rather than a plain error.

**Where the result goes.** The picture you started from is never touched. The
improvement arrives as its **own image in that checkpoint's gallery**, right next
to the original — open the gallery from the checkpoint pill (🖼) and you can
compare the two, download either, or pin the improved one onto the board beside
its source. Nothing moves on its own, which is why the confirmation says where to
look. The pass takes minutes, and a gallery already open does not refresh by
itself: close it and open it again to find the new picture waiting at the top.

Two things it deliberately will not do. An **improvement cannot be improved
again** — running two passes over the same pixels is how a face turns to
plastic — and the **lane's reference face** has no ✨ at all, because it is a
photo you supplied, not something the app generated. If a pass fails, press ✨
again: that is the retry.

**It stays out of the Test Studio.** These upscales are not sweep cells, so they
never appear in the Test Studio grid, never count as a run in progress, and never
enter the 👍/👎 ranking of a checkpoint — a rating you give an *upscale* would
otherwise be read as a vote for the checkpoint that did not produce it.

## Tips that save runs

- Trust the composition meter over your instinct — a set that "looks varied"
  is usually still face-heavy.
- Fix every leak the badge reports before training; one "a woman with long
  blonde hair" caption quietly competes with your trigger unless Hair is set
  to Describe in Captions ⚙️ Options.
- Don't chase steps. Train the auto count, then let the Test Studio find the
  *earliest* checkpoint that nails the identity — it keeps the most prompt
  flexibility.
- The next chapter — **Building a good dataset** — explains *why* behind every
  rule above. Read it once before your first serious run.

## 1. Pick your model family first

The family changes the caption style, the image count, and the settings — so decide
before you caption anything.

| | Z-Image | SDXL | Krea 2 | FLUX.1 | FLUX.2 Klein |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Caption style** | Prose sentences | Booru tags | Prose sentences | Prose sentences | Prose sentences |
| **Images (min → good)** | 12 → 20+ | 20 → 30+ | 15 → 20+ | 15 → 20+ | 15 → 20+ |
| **Training base** | Z-Image-Turbo (or a converted custom merge) | Your ComfyUI checkpoint (e.g. bigLove) | Krea-2-Raw (default), Turbo, or a Krea 2 checkpoint on your disk | FLUX.1-dev (gated HF) | FLUX.2-klein-base 4B (default) or 9B (gated HF) |
| **Preview quality** | Fast, distilled | Depends on checkpoint | Raw: slow but faithful | High, ~20 steps | Non-distilled, real CFG (~25 steps) |
| **Best for** | Fast iteration, prose-driven prompting | Booru-native checkpoints, NSFW ecosystems | Highest realism ceiling | The largest LoRA ecosystem, strong prompt fidelity | Modern FLUX.2 stack; 4B trains on mid-range GPUs |

**Krea note:** the default trains on **Krea-2-Raw** — the official recommendation is
*"train on Raw, validate on Turbo"*. Raw runs are long (hours); that's normal, not stuck.
The **Base** selector also lists every Krea 2 checkpoint sitting in your ComfyUI
\`unet\` / \`diffusion_models\` folders — a model one of your own full-model runs
delivered, or a community Krea 2 build — so you can keep training on top of one
instead of starting from the official weights every time. Entries carry a tag when
the file is quantized: \`· fp8 cast\` trains but starts from degraded weights,
\`· packed export\` cannot be loaded at all (see *Which quantized checkpoints can be
trained on* in section 10). Local runs use the file directly; a cloud run first
pushes it to your private Hugging Face repo, which the panel offers to do.

**FLUX.1 note:** trains on **FLUX.1-dev**, a *gated* Hugging Face model — accept its
license and set a HF token before the first run (the initial download is ~24 GB). It's
a 12B model like Krea 2, so **~24 GB VRAM** is the comfort zone (drop the resolution to
**768** to fit smaller cards). **Local training only for now**; in-app testing (Test
Studio) is coming — until then, test your Flux LoRA in your own ComfyUI.

**FLUX.2 Klein note:** two model sizes, picked next to the base selector — **4B**
(default) trains on a **16–24 GB** local GPU; **9B** needs **32–48 GB VRAM**.
Both bases are *gated* on Hugging Face: accept the license of
\`FLUX.2-klein-base-4B\` / \`-9B\` and set a HF token before the first run. In-app
testing (Test Studio) is coming — until then, test your Klein LoRA in your own
ComfyUI.

**Anima note (the one family that takes BOTH caption styles):** Anima is an anime
model with **hybrid prompting** — its model card documents *booru tags* and *natural
language* as equally supported, which its LLM text encoder is what makes possible. So
this is the family where the "match the style" rule below does **not** apply: caption
in prose, caption in booru tags, or keep an existing dataset as it is — the app will
not flag either as a mismatch, and you never have to force the launch. Prose is only
the preselected default. It trains on the open \`Anima-Base-v1.0-Diffusers\` (no gated
download) and is **local-only** for now.

---

## 2. How many images, and which ones

- **Target ~25 images** for a balanced character LoRA. More isn't automatically
  better — 25 varied images beat 60 near-duplicates every time.
- **Balance the framing.** The app tracks four buckets: **face / bust / body / back**.
  A dataset that is 100% face close-ups produces a LoRA that falls apart on
  full-body prompts — it has never seen the body.
- **Imported images may have no shot type yet.** Only images imported with the
  head-crop option on are tagged automatically; a plain drag-and-drop import (the
  default on body-fidelity datasets) leaves the shot type unknown, and unknown
  images count for nothing in the Composition bar — a whole import can leave it
  at 0. **📐 Classify framing (N)**, right under that bar in 📸 Add images, reads
  those images with the local vision model (Ollama) and sorts each into face /
  bust / body / back. It needs Ollama running with a vision model pulled
  (Settings ▸ Local tools); it uses the GPU and waits rather than competing with
  a training run. Nothing is deleted and images it cannot read stay unknown, so
  running it again only retries those.
- **A crop forgets the old shot type.** Cropping a body shot into a face (or a
  bust into a close-up) clears the stored framing, the same way a Bank crop
  does. Composition drops that image from its bucket until you run **📐 Classify
  framing** again — and the button only counts the ones that actually changed,
  not the whole set. Same vision model, same GPU wait.
- **Vary everything except the person:** location, lighting, outfit, pose,
  expression, camera angle. Whatever repeats across images gets baked into the
  LoRA — a repeated background wall becomes part of "the person".
- **Reject near-duplicates.** Two frames of the same shot teach nothing and
  overweight that look. The pre-flight check flags them; reject one of each pair.
- **Quality floor:** no motion blur, no heavy compression, the face readable.
  One bad image does more harm than one good image does good.

**Body fidelity mode** (Datasets → ⋯ More): use it when the body shape and body
marks (tattoos, scars) should bind to the trigger too. It shifts the composition
targets toward bust/body shots, imports full-frame by default, and extends the
caption rules below to body marks.

---

## 3. Captions — the make-or-break step

The model reads your captions during training and learns to attribute **whatever
the caption does NOT explain** to the trigger word.

**The golden rule: never describe what the person IS — describe everything else.**

- ❌ \`myTrigger, a woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes, smiling\` —
  the LoRA learns almost nothing: the caption already "explains" the appearance.
- ✅ \`myTrigger, sitting at a café table, warm afternoon light, denim jacket,
  looking at the camera\` — hair, face and skin are unexplained → they bind
  to \`myTrigger\`.

Concretely:

1. **Start every caption with the trigger word.** The app injects it on export.
2. **Never mention face, eyes or skin** — and, by default, hair. Those bind
   to the trigger. ⚙️ *Options* on the Captions panel has **Appearance in
   captions**: flip Hair, Makeup, Facial hair or Glasses to **Describe** when
   you want that look prompt-controllable (different hairstyles, no mascara in
   every gen). **Omit** keeps it bound to the trigger. Face, eye colour, skin,
   age, gender and ethnicity stay omitted. Extra instructions cannot reintroduce
   an omitted family — flip the row instead. The *identity-leak* check watches
   whatever is currently omitted.
3. **Describe scene, outfit, pose, lighting, framing** — and any appearance
   family you set to Describe. Those stay promptable *independently* of the
   identity.
4. **Vary the captions.** Identical captions across images teach nothing;
   captions under ~8 words are too weak to isolate the identity.
5. **Match the style to the family.** Prose for Z-Image and Krea; booru tags for
   SDXL booru-native checkpoints. The app blocks a mismatch for a reason —
   a prose-captioned SDXL LoRA produces disjointed images. **Anima is the
   exception:** it reads both forms natively, so neither is ever blocked there
   (see the Anima note above).

   ⚠️ **Concept datasets cannot be captioned in booru tags at all** (the concept
   captioner only writes prose). A Concept dataset on a booru-native SDXL
   checkpoint will therefore always be stopped by the caption-style check: train
   the concept on a prose family instead, or force the launch knowing the cost.

**Caption length.** ⚙️ *Options* on the Captions panel carries a **Caption length**
preset — *Standard* (the prompt untouched), *Concise* (aims for one short sentence,
~20–30 words) or *Detailed* (several sentences). It is a **target the vision model
follows loosely**, not a hard cap: expect a spread around it, not a word count. Pick
*Concise* when detailed captions keep describing the identity you want bound to the
trigger, *Detailed* when you want scene, outfit and lighting to stay independently
promptable.

What that looked like when measured — 18 real portrait photos, the shipped default
vision model (\`huihui_ai/qwen3-vl-abliterated:8b-instruct\`), the plain descriptive
prompt, one pass per preset:

| Preset | Median | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Concise | 24.5 words | 18–30 |
| Standard | 87.5 words | 65–112 |
| Detailed | 126 words | 106–152 |

Your numbers will differ — another vision model, JoyCaption, or a different kind of
image all move them. Treat the presets as *shorter / as-is / longer*, not as a
contract on a word count.

Two more things worth knowing:

- **Order.** The prompt is built as: the base prompt with its omission rules, then the
  vocabulary register, then the length preset, then your free **Extra instructions**
  last — so a hand-written steer that contradicts a preset is what the model reads
  most recently and wins. The identity/concept leak cleaners run after all of it
  regardless, so Extra instructions cannot reintroduce an omitted identity term.
  Flip **Appearance in captions** (Hair / Makeup / Facial hair / Glasses) when
  you *want* that look in the caption so it stays prompt-controllable.
- **Concise is not the "short" of long + short captions.** Dual captions derive a
  short variant *from* the stored long caption into its own field; the length preset
  changes the long caption itself. They are separate axes and compose freely.
- Concise stays **prose** on purpose (never a comma-separated tag list), so a Concise
  dataset still passes the caption-style check for prose-native families instead of
  being mistaken for booru tags at launch.

**Concept datasets** (training a *thing/style/act*, not a person) invert the rule:
describe everything **except the concept** — the concept is what must bind to the
trigger. Keep *person* masking **off** for concepts — a person mask would erase the
very thing you're training. Masking **faces** is the opposite polarity and is
available on purpose: see §8.

**Stopping a run.** Started a big caption pass and realized it's captioning badly,
or an option was mis-set? A **⏹ Stop** button sits in the captioning progress
banner. It finishes the image being written (an inference is never cut off
mid-way), then stops cleanly: every caption written so far is kept, the rest is
left untouched, and you get a *"stopped — X captioned"* summary. Nothing is killed
and nothing already done is lost — just fix the option and run again on what's left.

## 4. Settings cheat-sheet

The defaults below are the app's defaults (post-research). Change them from
⚙️ Advanced options on the training panel — each knob has its own why/how there.
That panel also has a **Presets** row: apply a shipped ★ recipe (*Krea
character*, *Concept*, *Style*), or save your tuned settings as a named preset to
reuse across datasets and share (import/export as JSON).

| Setting | Z-Image | SDXL | Krea 2 | FLUX.1 | FLUX.2 Klein | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LoRA rank / alpha** | 16 / 16 | 32 / 16 | 32 / 32 | 16 / 16 | 16 / 16 | Capacity to memorize the identity. SDXL's alpha = rank ÷ 2 is that family's half-strength convention. |
| **Resolution** | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | Multi-scale: holds up from close-up to full-body. |
| **Save checkpoint** | every 250 | every 250 | every 250 | every 250 | every 250 | More snapshots → better odds one is at the sweet spot. |
| **Steps** | auto | auto | auto | auto | auto | ~120 × images, clamped 1500–3500. A fixed 3000 overcooks small sets. |
| **Masked training** | ON | ON | ON | ON | ON | Background weighs only 10% of the loss → identity binds to the person, not the room. OFF for concepts — they have their own face masking instead (§8). |

Rules of thumb:

- **Raise rank (48–64)** only for a hard identity (distinctive features the
  default misses) *and* a bigger dataset — high rank on 15 images just memorizes them.
- **Don't chase steps.** More steps past the sweet spot = overfitting (plastic
  skin, same face angle everywhere, prompt deafness). Train with checkpoints
  every 250 and pick the best one instead.
- **Turbo variant (Krea)** is the VRAM/time-friendly fallback — fine for drafts,
  Raw for the final run.
- **GPU under 24 GB?** Resolution is the #1 memory lever: set it to **768 only**
  (Krea 2 especially — 1024 saturates a 24 GB card). You trade some fine detail
  for a run that actually fits and trains far faster.

### Steps — how many, and where "good results" start

The app sets the step count **automatically** for a character LoRA:
**≈ 120 × kept images, clamped to 1500–3500.** The *target is the same* for
Z-Image, SDXL, Krea 2, FLUX.1 and FLUX.2 Klein — the model family changes how *fast*
that target converges, not the number. (Concept/style datasets scale differently:
**475 · √n, clamped 2000–12000**, because they train on hundreds of images.)

So the character step count just follows your dataset size:

| Kept images | Auto steps |
|---|---|
| 12–15 | 1500 – 1800 |
| 20 | 2400 |
| 25 | 3000 |
| 30 and up | 3500 (capped) |

**"Good results" is a checkpoint you pick, not the finish line.** A snapshot is
saved every 250 steps, and the best one is almost never the last — later
checkpoints know the face better but obey prompts worse. *Where* the first
usable checkpoint appears depends on how fast the model converges:

| Model | Converges | Where the sweet spot tends to land |
|---|---|---|
| **Z-Image** | Fast (distilled) | Around the **middle** of the run; watch for overfit in the last ~20% (waxy skin, frozen expression) |
| **Krea 2 – Turbo** | Fast (distilled) | Like Z-Image — check early-to-middle checkpoints first |
| **SDXL** | Medium (base-dependent) | Middle of the run; booru-native checkpoints lock an identity quickly |
| **Krea 2 – Raw** | Slow (12B, non-distilled) | The **last third** — the run is long by design, let it finish the full count rather than stopping early |
| **FLUX.1-dev** | Medium (12B, guidance-distilled) | Middle of the run; a strong prompt-follower, so watch for waxy skin / frozen expression if you overshoot into the last ~20% |
| **FLUX.2 Klein (4B/9B)** | Medium (non-distilled base) | Middle of the run; previews run with real CFG so overfit shows honestly — pick the earliest checkpoint that holds the identity |

**Takeaway:** don't hand-tune the step number. Train the auto count, then use the
**Test Studio** to pick the *earliest* checkpoint that nails the identity — that's
the one with the most prompt flexibility left.

## 5. Pre-flight checklist

The app runs these checks when you hit Train — here's the list to self-check earlier:

- [ ] At least the family minimum kept (12 Z-Image / 20 SDXL / 15 Krea / 15 FLUX.1 / 15 FLUX.2 Klein) — 20–30 is the comfort zone
- [ ] Framing balanced — not 100% face shots (some bust/body/back)
- [ ] Every kept image captioned *(strongly recommended — a blank caption won't block the launch, it just asks you to confirm "train anyway")*
- [ ] **Zero identity leaks** (the leak badge shows 0 for whatever is currently omitted — face/eyes/skin, and by default hair)
- [ ] Captions varied, ≥ 8 words, style matches the family (prose vs booru — Anima takes either)
- [ ] Near-duplicate pairs resolved (keep one of each)
- [ ] Body fidelity: if ON, actual full-body shots exist

**Continue anyway.** When the readiness panel turns red over a *quality* blocker —
most often too few images for the family — a **Continue anyway** checkbox appears
under the list. Tick it and the Train button unlocks; the launch is recorded as
"acknowledged not-ready" in its saved config. It's meant for deliberate
experiments (you'll usually get an overfit LoRA), not for skipping the work. The
checkbox only ever covers quality guard-rails: genuine impossibilities that would
just crash the trainer — **zero kept images**, or a **slider with no prompt pair**
— are never offered the option, and the box un-ticks itself the moment the
blockers change.

**Train on.** With an ai-toolkit web address set (Settings → Training), a **Train
on** picker sits beside the Train button. **This machine** is the default and
behaves exactly as it always has. Pick another machine and the dataset is staged
over to it; its log, preview samples and checkpoints all arrive back here while
it runs — into the same folders a local run writes — so the panel, the checkpoint
browser and the Runs page read normally and the run gets its own **⏹ Stop**. Base
models are not copied — the machine that trains downloads its own. The readiness
checks above run either way. A remote run **always starts fresh** (previous
checkpoints are not sent over), so there is no Resume/Fresh question for one, and
only **one run per dataset** can be out at a time. The picker never offers this machine's own
GPUs: a run in that lane does not hold the local GPU-busy flag, so image
generation would start on top of it. Full details, including why an offline
machine is greyed out rather than hidden:
[Settings → Training](guide/settings-reference.md#train-on-another-machine).

**When the link to that machine breaks.** Losing contact is not the same as
losing the run, and the panel says which happened. If this app cannot reach the
other machine for about a minute, the run is **not** written off — the job is
most likely still training over there. The card says contact was lost, the run
stays open, and it is picked back up when this app restarts. Press **⏹ Stop** if
you would rather give up on it; that ends it here and says plainly that the job
may still be running on the other machine. A run whose training **finished** but
whose files could not be copied back is reported as finished, with the reason —
the checkpoints exist, they are just still over there, and training again brings
them home. A run that reached the other machine but was never actually started
(this app closing at exactly the wrong moment) says that too, rather than
appearing to have stopped for no reason; training again picks the same job up.

**Stopping a training run.** The red **⏹ Stop training** button next to Train
ends the run in progress — it is not a housekeeping button. It kills the training
process, clears the pending local training queue, and hands the GPU back to
ComfyUI. What you keep: **every checkpoint already saved**, which stays testable
in the Studio and can be continued later with ▶ Continue. Because a run can be
hours long, the button asks for confirmation first. The same run can also be
stopped from the **Runs** hub ("Stop run"), which does exactly the same thing.

---

## 6. After training: pick the right checkpoint

Training produces a checkpoint every 250 steps — **the last one is often NOT the
best one**. Later checkpoints know the identity better but obey prompts worse.

1. Open the **Test Studio** from the dataset (the LoRA comes pre-selected).
2. Generate the same prompt grid across several checkpoints and strengths.
3. Pick the **earliest checkpoint that nails the identity** — it keeps the most
   prompt flexibility. Signs you've gone too far: waxy skin, identical
   expression/angle regardless of prompt, outfits from the dataset bleeding in.
4. Save the winning settings (★) — they're reused as the dataset's defaults.

### Test several prompts in one launch

Under the prompt box is the history of the prompts you have saved, with a
thumbnail of the image you liked best for each. Clicking a card loads it into the
field, as before. **Ticking its box adds it to a batch**: the panel counts what is
selected, the button says how many prompts it is about to run, and one launch
renders them all — same checkpoints, same settings, **same seed**, which is what
makes two prompts comparable rather than two unrelated pictures.

It is one run, not several: the images queue up and the GPU works through them by
itself. Tick nothing and the screen behaves exactly as it always has, running the
prompt in the field.

**There is no limit on how many you tick.** What there is instead is the price,
shown before you click: the panel counts every generation the run will queue and
estimates how long it takes **at the pace your machine has actually been running
at** — measured from your own recent test generations, not assumed. Past about an
hour it asks once whether you meant it. The queue is serial, so you can stop it at
any point and everything already generated is kept.

The same tick boxes are in **🎨 Generate from the board** on the ◉ LoRA Canvas,
because both screens show the same prompt history.

### Compare LoRAs — or blend them

Check two or more LoRAs and Studio asks what you want to do with them:

- **⚖ Compare** (the default) tests each LoRA **on its own**, one column per LoRA,
  swept across the strengths you picked. This is what you want to answer "which of
  these is better".
- **🧬 Blend** loads them **together in the same image**, each at its own weight,
  and injects **every trigger word** into the prompt for you. This is what you want
  to answer "do these two work together" — a character plus a style, or a character
  plus a concept.

> This mode was called **🧬 Combine** until August 2026. Only the name changed;
> the ◉ LoRA Canvas offers the very same thing from the board, and calling it two
> different things was a needless thing to learn twice.

**What blending two characters actually gives you** is a *hybrid* — one person who
is neither of the two, not both of them side by side in one shot. That is a real
and deliberate use, but if you expected "my two characters together", this is not
it. The reliable pairings are **character + style** and **character + concept**.

In Blend mode the strength sweep disappears: each LoRA already carries its own
weight, so the run is one configuration instead of a grid. Start both around
0.7-0.9 — two LoRAs at 1.0 usually fight each other, and the one you care about
most should be the heavier of the two. Result tiles from a stack carry a **🧬**
badge naming the exact weights that made them.

**Steps and CFG are set in the same panel, in both modes.** They are render
settings, not LoRA settings, so they stay available when the strength sweep
disappears in Blend — and like every other axis, ticking two values renders both
(the cell counter shows what that costs before you launch). SDXL also exposes its
second pass there.

**Trying several weights at once.** Under each LoRA's slider is a row of weight
boxes. Tick two on one LoRA and two on the other, and the launch renders **all
four combinations** in a single run — the search you would otherwise do by
launching, looking, moving a slider and launching again. Each image is labelled
with its own pair, and the stack view lines the combinations up side by side so
you can pick the one that works and save its weights with ★.

Tick nothing and the slider governs, exactly as before the boxes existed; the
slider is also how you use a weight that is not on the grid. Tick one box and you
get one configuration — one image — like any other blend.

The count is spelled out before you launch ("4 weight combinations → 4 images,
about 1 min"), and past 24 images it turns amber and says so. It never refuses:
the queue is serial and it is your machine. Two LoRAs at four weights each is 16
images — the multiplication is quick, which is exactly why the panel does it for
you.

**One family per run, always.** A Krea LoRA and an SDXL LoRA cannot be blended:
they need different base models and different workflows. The picker greys out the
other families as soon as you check one, and a run that somehow mixes them is
refused with both family names in the message.

### Enhance a short prompt

**✨ Enhance** rewrites what you typed into a fuller prompt using your local Ollama
model — it adds framing, pose, lighting, background and mood, and deliberately
leaves identity and trigger words alone (the LoRA supplies the identity, and Studio
injects the trigger itself at generation time).

It is a local feature: without Ollama installed, running, and with its model pulled,
the button is **greyed out and says which of the three is missing** rather than
failing when you press it. Install or start it from **Settings › Local tools**.

### Reuse a dataset caption in Studio

Press **🎲 Caption** for a realistic test prompt from work you already curated.
The first use asks which dataset to draw from; after that, each main-button click
inserts a random **nonblank caption from a kept image** in that dataset. Studio
remembers the chosen source in this browser's localStorage. Use **▾** beside the
button to change the source dataset.

The source needs at least one kept image with a nonblank caption. If you have
typed a prompt, Studio asks before replacing it.

### Borrow a prompt from Civitai's top images

**🌐 Civitai** (next to the prompt field, on every generation surface) browses
the most-reacted Civitai images of the day, week, month, year or all time —
each image shown side by side with the generation prompt it was posted with.
**⤵ Use prompt** drops it into your prompt field (asking first if you typed
something), **📋 Copy** puts it on the clipboard, and clicking the picture
opens it on Civitai.

Two honest limits:

- **Not every image publishes its prompt.** The browser keeps only the ones
  that do by default; untick *Only images with a prompt* to see the full top.
- **Reading prompts needs a Civitai API key** (free account) — the same key
  the scraper uses, stored once in **Settings › Scraping & sources**. Without
  it the top images still show, but Civitai refuses the prompt data.

The content-level select is a ceiling (*Safe* by default, up to *Everything*);
your filters are remembered in this browser's localStorage.

### Continue a run instead of starting over

If the best checkpoint is *almost* there — the identity nearly locked but a touch
undercooked — you don't have to retrain from scratch. The **▶ Continue training**
button (on the dataset's Checkpoints panel and on the **Runs** hub) opens a small
dialog:

- **Resume from** — which checkpoint to restart from. The default is the latest,
  but the whole point is that you can pick an **earlier, less-cooked epoch**: the
  classic case where step 750 held up better than the over-cooked 1000. Choosing
  an earlier step never destroys the run's later saves — they're set aside intact
  on disk, and the continuation writes
  its own.
- **Extra steps** — how many *more* steps to train; the dialog shows the target
  step you'll land on.
- **Adjust settings (optional)** — a resume can only safely change a handful of
  things: the **checkpoint/preview cadence**, the **preview prompts** and the
  **preview steps and CFG** (test images only — never the weights), and the
  **timestep weighting**. Everything structural
  (rank, base model, optimizer) is locked to the checkpoint you're continuing.
  The timestep knob enables a known **two-phase recipe**: train balanced first,
  then continue with a low-noise-leaning emphasis to polish fine texture.

- **Run it** — on this machine's GPU. A checkpoint is just a file, so one trained
  elsewhere can be continued here just the same. This fork has **no rented-GPU
  lane** — upstream's ☁ Cloud choice is removed, and a continuation always runs
  on the Primary's own card. When it can't run at all — no ai-toolkit, a training
  already going here — the button is disabled **with the reason**, never hidden.
  The **Runs** page's ▶ Continue behaves identically, counting that reason
  against *that run's* dataset, since the page lists runs from all of them.

You can also click a checkpoint pill in the **◉ Graph** and pick *▶ Continue from
here*: the dialog opens already set on that step.

Continue also works from the Runs hub, for any run listed there.

## 7. Dual captions (long + short)

An optional, **off-by-default** training technique, toggled under **⚙️ Advanced
options → Dual captions** on the training panel. When on, the run uses
ai-toolkit's native \`short_and_long_captions\`: **every image trains with both its
full caption and a short one.** It's a *text-side augmentation* — showing the
model two phrasings of the same image so the LoRA leans less on any single
wording and generalizes to prompts that don't match your caption style.

How the short caption is produced:

- It's **derived from the long caption**, automatically, the next time you
  (re-)caption — text-only, via the local vision model. Turning the toggle on
  doesn't rewrite anything by itself; **re-caption** to generate the shorts.
- It follows the **same kind rules** as the long one: no trigger word, and the
  identity / concept / aesthetic stays omitted (that's still the trigger's job).
- You can **edit it per image** in the **⛶** caption editor, next to the long one.

**Not carried by every lane.** A dataset staged for a machine that has no copy of the
JSON file the short caption is read from trains on the long caption alone; on this
fork every run is local, so the toggle applies to all of them.

**Not on Krea 2 or Anima.** Those two families pre-cache their text embeddings and
unload the text encoder to fit their DiT in VRAM. ai-toolkit caches exactly one
embedding per image — the long caption — and once the encoder is gone the training
loop reads those cached embeddings instead of the caption text, so a second caption
has nowhere to be encoded. Asking for both used to crash the run at the first step,
*after* the weights download and the whole caching pass (reported by **1Tomber**,
GitHub #22). The app now refuses the combination when it builds the training config:
the toggle says so, the pre-launch check warns, and the run trains on the long
caption alone — trigger word included, exactly like a normal run.

---

## 8. Concept LoRAs: keeping faces out

A Concept LoRA learns the one thing every image shares. If those images all show
people, it quietly learns **their faces too** — and when you later stack it with a
Character LoRA, the two pull against each other over whose face to render. This was
reported by **shivdbz2010 (GitHub)**.

Turn on **Mask faces** in *Advanced options* on a Concept dataset. Faces are
detected and **weighed down in the training loss**, so the concept binds to the act
instead of to the people in your photos.

**Your images are not touched.** Nothing is blurred, pixelated or painted over.
That distinction matters: a blurred face would *be* what the model is trained to
reproduce, and the LoRA would learn to render blurry faces. A loss mask says
"don't correct me here" instead, so nothing at all is learned in that area.

Before you rely on it:

- **Variety beats masking.** The people who maintain these trainers say dataset
  diversity matters more here. A concept demonstrated by ten different people
  already dilutes identity; with two, the faces are as constant as the concept and
  no mask fully compensates.
- **Preview it.** The training panel draws the mask on your own shots and shows how
  many images got no face at all. A *partly* masked set is the bad case: the faces
  left unmasked become the only ones the LoRA still learns faces from, so they end
  up over-represented.
- **You can stop the preview, and it resumes.** On a large set the pass takes a
  while, so **Stop** is next to it — and what it already found is kept. Start it
  again and it continues from where it stopped rather than from image 1. The
  button says what stopping costs at the moment you press it, because that
  changes: the face detector is loaded before the first image and that load is
  paid again on every start, so stopping *during* the load gives up only the
  load, while stopping *during* the analysis keeps every face found so far.
  Change your kept images and the saved work is dropped instead of reused —
  boxes detected on photos that left the set would describe a run that no longer
  exists.
- **If your concept lives on the face** — an expression, a mouth, a gaze — masking
  the head can erase what you're teaching. The app warns when your description says
  so; it doesn't stop you, because only you know your dataset.
- **Nobody has measured this.** There's no published before/after of a concept LoRA
  trained with and without face masking. This gives you the lever, not a promise.

Two knobs live in **Settings ▸ Training**: how far the detected face box is grown
into a head, and how much the masked area still counts. Neither is zero, on
purpose — see the settings reference.

---

## 9. Coverage — what your set never showed

Section 2 says "vary everything except the person". The Composition bar cannot
check that: it counts face / bust / body / back against a target, so a set of
twenty-five front-on studio portraits in one outfit reaches a **fully green
target** while having no profile, no daylight and no second outfit. The LoRA that
comes out reproduces that one look and nothing else.

**🔍 Coverage**, the collapsible panel right under the Composition bar, is that
second check. Open it and it reports, per axis, what your captions describe and
what they never mention:

| Axis | What a gap means |
|---|---|
| Camera view | frontal / three-quarter / profile — a character with no profile has a side nobody ever saw |
| Camera height | eye level / low / high / overhead — eye-level-only is the default trap |
| Lighting | daylight, indoor, golden hour, studio, night, backlit, overcast |
| Setting | indoor, outdoor, urban, plain backdrop, water, vehicle |
| Outfit | counts how many **distinct** outfit types appear — one outfit gets learned as part of the person |
| Expression | counts how many distinct expressions appear |

Which axes apply depends on the dataset kind. A **style** dataset is judged on
lighting, setting and view only — "one outfit" is not a defect when the outfit is
not what you are teaching. A **concept** dataset drops the expression axis.

### What it can and cannot see

This is deliberately a cheap check, not a second model. It reads **the words in
the captions you already generated** — nothing new runs, there is no GPU cost,
and the numbers appear instantly. That comes with real limits, and the panel
repeats them on screen rather than hiding them:

- **No captions, no reading.** With an uncaptioned dataset the panel says so
  instead of drawing empty bars. Run the caption pass first.
- **It sees descriptions, not pixels.** A profile shot the captioner described
  without the word "profile" is invisible here. An absence is strong evidence,
  not proof.
- **Negation is not parsed.** "not smiling" counts as a smile.
- **Under five captions it refuses to judge** — at that size everything looks
  missing for the wrong reason.
- **It never selects, keeps, rejects or changes anything.** It is advice.

### Clicking a chip shows you those images

A number tells you *profile 3*; it does not tell you **which** three, and hunting
for them by eye in a grid of two hundred is the part that made the panel easy to
read and hard to act on. **Click any chip that has a count** and the grid opens
filtered to exactly the images that chip counted, with \`🔍 profile — camera view\`
in the filter bar and the usual *clear all* next to it.

It stays advice: filtering changes which images you are *looking at*, never what
they are. Nothing is kept, rejected, recaptioned or reordered by the click, and
removing the chip brings the whole grid back.

Two things follow from the panel reading captions rather than pixels, and they
are worth knowing before you trust a filter:

- **The filter shows what the chip counted, no more.** Rejected and failed images
  are outside the panel's pool, so they stay outside its filter — the number and
  the images you get can never disagree.
- **A chip with a zero is not clickable**, because there is nothing to show. That
  is the gap the panel is pointing at, and the answer to it is generating or
  importing, not filtering.

Pair it with **Sort ▸ Shot type** on the grid and the two compose: filter to the
profiles, group what is left by shot type, and decide what to keep with like
sitting next to like.

The panel reads the same pool the Composition bar counts: everything that is not
rejected and not failed. It also tells you how many images have **no shot type
yet**, which is the one thing the bar above silently drops.

## 10. Local fp8 model conversion

The Training panel includes **Quantize an existing model to fp8** for full-precision
\`.safetensors\` checkpoints already on this machine. It runs on the CPU and writes
\`<name>_fp8.safetensors\` beside the source; the source is never modified and an
existing output is never silently overwritten.

- It runs on the **CPU**, not the GPU: the work is an elementwise cast plus one
  reduction per tensor (measured ~1.2 GB/s here, so a 26 GB file is bound by your
  disk, not by arithmetic). Nothing competes with ComfyUI or a training run.
- It runs in a **separate Python** — the one that has \`torch\` (the app installs
  without it; torch is gigabytes). Whether that environment can actually do the
  work is checked *while the plan is drawn*: one that cannot disables the button
  and names what to install, rather than failing after the click or, worse,
  after the download.
- **The size of the model has no bearing on whether it opens.** It is read one
  tensor at a time. Mapping the whole file used to reserve its entire size
  up front, which is why a big checkpoint could fail with "the paging file is
  too small" on a machine with plenty of free memory and disk.
- One at a time, app-wide, and it checks free space before it reads a byte.
- It **refuses a file that is already quantized** — quantizing twice only loses
  more precision — and refuses a LoRA or adapter, which has nothing large enough
  to shrink.
- When it finishes it **re-opens the file it just wrote** and checks the marker,
  the per-tensor scales and the payload dtype, so a bad conversion is reported
  now rather than at generation time.

> **This is not ai-toolkit's \`quantize\`.** The \`quantize\` / memory options in
> Advanced training shrink the model *in memory while it loads*, so a smaller
> card can train something that would not otherwise fit. They write nothing: the
> saved checkpoint is still full precision. This feature produces the **file**.

### Testing a full model: it is a RAW checkpoint

The artifact is **undistilled**. Krea 2 Turbo-style settings — CFG 1 and a
handful of steps — produce a blurry sketch on it, which reads as "the training
failed" when nothing failed at all. Use the same settings the run previewed
with: **CFG ~4 (3.5-5) and 20-30 steps**. The Test Studio now pre-fills those
automatically when the selected base looks like a Raw / full / fp8 checkpoint.

### Which quantized checkpoints can be trained on, and which cannot

**The format decides, not the number of bits.** "Quantized" covers two different
files, and only one of them is a wall:

- a **packed export** — ComfyUI's scaled fp8 and its newer \`comfy_quant\` form,
  every int8 repack, and the fp8 twin this app itself writes — stores its
  decompression tables as *extra tensors* (\`scaled_fp8\`, \`<layer>.scale_weight\`,
  \`<layer>.comfy_quant\`). A trainer loads a base strictly: those tensors are keys
  it does not know, so **the load fails immediately** — not mid-run, not at the
  first optimizer step. This one is refused, and the message names both the
  obstacle and the way out;
- a **plain fp8 cast** stores the weights in fp8 under the tensor names the
  full-precision file already had, adding nothing. There is no unknown key for the
  strict load to trip on: the trainer up-casts it to bf16 as it loads. This one is
  **allowed**. Several widely used Krea 2 checkpoints — including the Turbo file
  most people already have — are of this kind, and refusing them closed a path
  that works.

Allowed is not recommended. Picking a cast base shows a warning with the actual
numbers (how many of the file's tensors are stored in fp8, and how many
significand bits that leaves against bf16's 8): the precision the cast dropped
does not come back, so the run starts from an already-degraded base and the LoRA
it produces is worse than the same run on the full-precision file, for the same
GPU time. Train on it if that is the file you have — the point is that you know
what it costs, not that you should not.

**What this check does not answer.** It reads how the file is *packed*, not
whether the model family can accept its tensors. A checkpoint can pass here and
still be refused at load for carrying a tensor the architecture does not declare.
Real case, found while building this: a widely circulated fp8 conversion of Krea 2
Turbo carries two extra 6144×6144 tensors under weight-shaped names — its own
metadata describes them as an embedded image, not weights — and a strict load
rejects them. That failure also happens in the first seconds, before any GPU time
is spent, and it comes with the trainer's own message naming the keys.

**The way out of a refusal is a click, not a download.** A full-model run keeps
its bf16 master next to the fp8 twin, and the Checkpoints panel lists that master
by name — pick it there. If the only copy you have is a packed export, the
full-precision version has to come from wherever the model was published; there
is no way back from a packed file, which is why *Keep the bf16 master* is on by
default.

The check reads a few kilobytes of file header — the quantization markers and the
tensor dtypes — so it costs nothing and fires the moment you pick the file, not
an hour into a paid run. A file whose header cannot be read is let through: the
app refuses what it can prove, never what it merely suspects.

## 11. Preview quality — steps and CFG

The preview images a run writes every few hundred steps are the only thing you
can judge it by while it is still running, so they have to be *readable*. How
they are rendered is two numbers — how many **steps** each preview gets, and at
what **guidance (CFG)** — and both live in ⚙️ **Advanced options** under
*Preview quality*, next to the cadence and the prompts.

**Leave them empty and nothing changes.** The boxes show, as a placeholder, the
default your base resolves to; that default follows the model you picked, because
the right answer is a property of the base and not a preference:

| Base | Preview default | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A **distilled** one (Krea 2 Turbo, Z-Image Turbo) | 8 steps, CFG 1 | Distillation is what buys the few-step sampling. Asking for 25 steps at CFG 4 wastes minutes per preview and does not look better. |
| An **undistilled** one (Krea 2 Raw, Z-Image, FLUX, SDXL) | 20-35 steps, CFG 4-6 | At a distilled model's 8 steps these come back as unfinished sketches — muddy, half-formed — and you cannot tell a bad run from a bad preview. |

You need the boxes when you train on a base the studio does not ship — a merge of
your own, a converted checkpoint — because then the default is a guess about a
model nobody measured. Symptoms worth acting on: previews that look like
sketches (raise the steps), or a preview that visibly costs more time than the
training it interrupts (lower them).

These are **preview settings only**: they change the picture, never the weights.
That is also why a **▶ Continue** can change them even in *full training state*
mode, where the cadence and the learning rate are locked — a resume is exactly
when you have already seen the previews and know they are unreadable.

## The page is completely blank on Windows, in every browser

**Symptom:** the server log looks healthy, but the page is white and no browser
loads the interface.

**Why:** Windows stores a content type for each extension in
\`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\<ext>\\Content Type\`. Another program can overwrite the
\`.js\` value with \`text/plain\`; older LDS builds then served the bundle with
that registry MIME type and browsers refused to execute it.

**Fix:** update LoRA Dataset Studio and restart it. Current builds set the MIME
type of served assets themselves and do not trust the Windows registry. If an
old build must be used temporarily, repair the \`.js\` Content Type to a
JavaScript MIME type, then restart the browser. Updating is safer than making a
registry edit by hand.

*(Reported and diagnosed in [GitHub #12](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/issues/12).)*

## "No Z-Image model available" in the Test Studio or training panel

**Why:** the Test Studio generates through ComfyUI, so the Z-Image *base model*
must physically live in your ComfyUI install — and the scanner only accepts it
inside a sub-folder whose name contains \`z image\` (or \`zimage\`). A file dropped
loose in \`models/unet\` is **not** detected.

**Fix:** lay the stack out like this inside your ComfyUI folder, then re-test:

\`\`\`
models/unet/z image/<your Z-Image checkpoint>.safetensors
models/text_encoders/Z image/qwen_3_4b.safetensors
models/vae/z ae.safetensors
\`\`\`

**The text encoder and the VAE are flexible** — only the base model needs that
sub-folder. The app resolves those two itself: any capitalisation, any separator
and any sub-folder work, so \`models/vae/z_ae.safetensors\`, \`models/vae/ae.safetensors\`
(the name ComfyUI's own Z-Image page uses), \`text_encoders/Z Image/qwen_3_4b.safetensors\`
and a bare \`text_encoders/qwen_3_4b.safetensors\` are all found, including under an
\`extra_model_paths.yaml\` root. **Do not rename your files to match the layout above.**
If the app still says one is missing, the message lists what it accepted and where it
looked; you can also pin either file by hand with the \`zimage.vae\` /
\`zimage.text_encoder\` settings (see *Settings reference → Config-file-only settings*).

A Z-Image LoRA only works on a Z-Image base — a regular SD/SDXL graph
(20–30 steps, CFG 7) renders garbage. The two Z-Image builds then want opposite
sampler settings, and the Test Studio proposes the right pair per base model:
**Z-Image-Turbo** is guidance-distilled and wants euler / simple / **8 steps /
CFG 1.0**, while the non-distilled **Z-Image Base** needs roughly **30–50 steps at
CFG 3–5** (ComfyUI's own recommendation) — run Base at CFG 1 and it renders mush.
Those are starting points on a sweepable axis, not measured optima: the Studio grid
exists to let you find yours.

## "No SDXL checkpoint found" on a fresh install

**Why:** the app derives the models folder from **Settings → Local tools →
ComfyUI install directory**. If only the API URL is set, there's nothing to scan.

**Fix:** point the install directory at the folder that contains \`models/\` and
\`main.py\` (the Setup wizard detects it for you), then hit **Test**. SDXL
checkpoints are scanned from \`models/checkpoints\`.

## The Krea 2 Turbo Test Studio says a custom node is missing

**Why:** the Krea grid rebalances the Qwen3-VL conditioning through a small
community node (class \`ConditioningKrea2Rebalance\`). It isn't a stock ComfyUI
node, so a ComfyUI that doesn't have it can't run the Krea pipeline and the
Studio stops before wasting a run — the same up-front check used for missing
model files.

**Fix:** install the **ComfyUI-Conditioning-Rebalance** pack (in ComfyUI-Manager,
search **"Krea 2 Conditioning"** — repo
\`https://github.com/nova452/ComfyUI-Conditioning-Rebalance\`), then restart
ComfyUI and relaunch the test. The Studio's error banner names this pack and
links it directly. Either that original pack or its \`comfyui-krea2-conditioning\`
fork works — the app pins the node so your rebalance-strength setting is applied
the same way on both.

## The reference crop isn't centered on the face

**Why:** on a fresh clone the configured Ollama vision model isn't pulled yet,
so head detection silently falls back to a centered square crop. The app now
shows a warning toast naming the missing model when this happens.

**Fix:** **Setup → Ollama** — pull the vision model (use the **Instruct**
variant, not *Thinking*), or click the tile's crop button and frame it by hand.
**↺ Reset to auto** re-runs the auto-crop after the model is installed.

## Ollama isn't detected (or is installed but stopped)

In Docker, host binary detection is not the deployment selector. Open **Setup → Ollama** and choose:

| Docker choice | Expected state | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **No Ollama** | Disabled by choice | Choose another card only if you want the Ollama features |
| **Existing host Ollama** | API at \`http://host.docker.internal:11434\` | Start Ollama on the host, bind it so Docker can reach it, and restrict port 11434 to Docker/private networks |
| **Docker Ollama** | Companion API at \`http://ollama:11434\` | If the companion is absent, rerun the same LDS Docker launcher |

On a native install, LDS still distinguishes **not installed**, **installed but stopped**, and **running**. The **▶ Start Ollama** button applies only to a detected native binary.

No launcher or **Install everything** action pulls the large vision model. Once the selected service is reachable, use the explicit **Pull** button in LDS Setup; it shows progress and supports cancellation/resume. Keep the **Instruct** tag. The Thinking variant reasons instead of returning the compact captions these workflows expect.

## Training log looks frozen for several minutes

**Why:** ai-toolkit's output is block-buffered during model load and latent
caching — nothing prints even though it's working. A "warming up" phase before
the first logged step is expected, and Krea-2-Raw runs are *hours* long by
design.

**Fix:** nothing to fix — check GPU utilization or watch the ai-toolkit output
folder for new files if you want proof of life. Open **Runs** to watch live
progress for the current local training.

## Training dies immediately on an RTX 50-series card ("no kernel image is available")

**Why:** an RTX 50-series/Blackwell GPU reports compute capability \`sm_120\`.
An older torch build can still report \`torch.cuda.is_available() == True\` and
name the card correctly while carrying no kernel for that architecture. The run
then fails on its first real CUDA operation.

**Fix:** install a CUDA 12.8 torch build **inside ai-toolkit's own Python
environment**, not only in the LDS venv:

\`\`\`bash
python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
\`\`\`

Run that command with the exact Python configured under **Settings → Local
tools → ai-toolkit Python interpreter**. The preflight/failure panel recognizes
this specific \`sm_120\` mismatch. For another architecture mismatch, use the
torch build appropriate to that card instead of copying this command blindly.

## ai-toolkit isn't detected (conda / uv / no venv)

**Why:** the app auto-detects ai-toolkit's Python from a \`venv/\` or \`.venv/\`
folder next to its \`run.py\`. Installs that use conda, uv or the system Python
have no such folder, so the Test button can't find an interpreter — training
and JoyCaption stay hidden.

**Fix:** in **Settings → Local tools → ai-toolkit**, keep the directory pointing
at the ai-toolkit folder and fill the optional **Python interpreter** field with
the full path to the python that has ai-toolkit's dependencies (e.g.
\`C:\\miniconda3\\envs\\aitk\\python.exe\`), then hit **Test**. ComfyUI Desktop installs
are recognized automatically — no extra step.

## Reddit scan says "rate limiting requests, retry in Ns" (429)

**Why:** out of the box, Reddit scans authenticate with a **public client id
shared by many people** (the gallery-dl one). Reddit's quota — about 1000
requests per 10-minute window — is attached to that id, so other users can
exhaust it before your very first scan of the day. The "retry in Ns" number is
just the time left in the current 10-minute window.

**Fix:** get your own free client ID (one minute, no app secret involved):
**Settings → Scraping & sources** has the field plus a built-in step-by-step
guide. The one trap: on reddit.com/prefs/apps, pick the app type
**installed app** — a *web app* or *script* id comes with a client secret and
Reddit then rejects the anonymous login this app uses (every scan fails
with 401). Takes effect immediately, no restart needed.

## ComfyUI shows as unreachable

Check **Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI API URL** (default
\`http://127.0.0.1:8188\`), confirm ComfyUI is running, and check that a firewall
or a different bind interface is not blocking the connection.

The test has two different failure paths:

- **Connection refused/unreachable** returns quickly and tells you to start
  ComfyUI or correct the URL.
- **ComfyUI answered but its node/model inventory timed out** means the process
  may simply be slow. Large custom-node and model collections make
  \`/object_info\` expensive. LDS waits **45 seconds** by default; raise
  \`comfyui.object_info_timeout_s\` under **Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI**
  and test again.

Do not keep increasing the timeout for a refused connection: a genuinely stopped
ComfyUI is detected in seconds. If the URL test succeeds but generation still
fails, continue with the shared-filesystem case below.

## ComfyUI runs in another container (or WSL, or another machine) and generation fails

**Symptom:** setup goes green — the ComfyUI URL answers, the install directory is
accepted — and then every generation fails.

**Why:** the app talks to ComfyUI through **two** channels, and only one of them is
the network.

1. **The HTTP API** (\`Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI API URL\`). This is what the
   *Test* button and the Setup wizard check.
2. **The filesystem.** Every local engine (Klein, Krea 2 Edit, Klein watermark
   cleaning) hands ComfyUI its source image by **copying the file into ComfyUI's
   \`input/\` folder**, and the result comes back from its \`output/\` folder. There is
   no upload over the API on that path.

A ComfyUI in a separate container, in WSL, or on another host does not share those
folders with the app by default. The URL answers, so everything looks configured —
and then the copy writes into a folder ComfyUI cannot see, or fails outright.

**What it takes to work:**

- \`input/\` and \`output/\` must be visible **to both sides at the same path**. Not
  "an equivalent folder": the app writes \`<input>/edit_source_….png\` and then tells
  ComfyUI to load \`edit_source_….png\` from *its own* input folder — the two must be
  the same directory.
- The app's process must be able to **write** into \`input/\` (a read-only bind mount
  is not enough), and ComfyUI must be able to read it.
- If ComfyUI was started with \`--input-directory\` / \`--output-directory\`, set the
  matching paths in **Settings → Local tools → Advanced: ComfyUI folder overrides**.
  Those fields take the path **as seen by the app**.

With Docker, that means bind-mounting the same host folders into both containers at
identical paths, e.g.:

\`\`\`yaml
# both services
volumes:
  - /srv/comfyui/input:/srv/comfyui/input
  - /srv/comfyui/output:/srv/comfyui/output
\`\`\`

and then pointing the two override fields at \`/srv/comfyui/input\` and
\`/srv/comfyui/output\`. The shipped \`docker-compose.yml\` deliberately does **not**
do this: it runs the app in curation-only mode, where ComfyUI is out of scope.

**How you'll know:** the failure now says so. Settings flags an override folder it
cannot write into, the Setup wizard warns while you configure (a warning, never a
blocker — mounting volumes afterwards is fine), and a generation that cannot reach
the folder answers with the folder path and the reason instead of a bare \`500\`.
Those messages are path-redacted, so they are safe to paste in a help thread.

**Everything else keeps working without shared folders**: scraping, curation,
captioning through Ollama, training, and Hugging Face publishing. Only the
ComfyUI engines need the filesystem.

*(Reported by nofaceman on Discord.)*

## "Value not in list" on every model, on Linux (fixed)

**Symptom:** on a Linux install, nothing generated at all. ComfyUI's console showed,
for every workflow:

\`\`\`
Failed to validate prompt for output 28:
* UNETLoader 20:
  - Value not in list: unet_name: 'Krea\\krea2_turbo_fp8.safetensors'
    not in ['Krea/krea2_turbo_fp8.safetensors']
\`\`\`

**Why:** ComfyUI builds its model lists with the separator of **its own** host —
backslash on Windows, forward slash on Linux — and validates a model widget by
exact string match. The app spelled those names with a Windows backslash whatever
the platform, and it keeps every model in a subfolder (\`Krea\`, \`klein\`,
\`z image\`, and every LoRA you train), so on Linux the answer was "nothing works"
rather than "one model is missing".

**Fixed:** the app now reads the spelling from the ComfyUI it is actually talking
to and matches it. This also covers the reverse case — the app on Windows driving
a ComfyUI in WSL, Docker or on another machine, which needs forward slashes — so
there is nothing to configure either way.

*(Found and diagnosed by 1Tomber, [GitHub #21](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/issues/21).)*

## Klein engine stays greyed out

Klein needs a reachable ComfyUI **and** the Klein model files (~16 GB VRAM
class). **Setup → ComfyUI** offers the download; the license-gated fp8 model
needs a Hugging Face token (Settings → Local tools).

Whatever the cause, the greyed-out engine now **names it**, and the Setup wizard
shows the same sentence — the two screens read one verdict, so they cannot send
you to fix different things. The causes, and what each one means:

| What it says | What it means | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`Configure ComfyUI in Settings\` | ComfyUI is not answering | Start it, or fix the API URL |
| \`Klein <file(s)> missing\` | that weight is not on disk | Download it in Setup ▸ Install components |
| \`… is on disk but cannot be loaded\` | the file is there but unreadable | See below |
| \`Your ComfyUI doesn't have <value>\` | the graph pins a widget value your ComfyUI doesn't offer | Install the named node pack, restart ComfyUI |
| \`disabled in Settings (engines)\` | you turned the engine off | Re-enable it in Settings ▸ Engines |

### Where the Klein model may live — you do **not** need \`models/unet/klein/\`

\`models/unet/klein/\` is only where the Setup button *downloads* to. It has never
been a requirement, and nothing needs to be copied, moved or symlinked to satisfy
it. The app resolves the Klein UNET exactly where a running ComfyUI would, in
this order:

| Layout | Example |
| --- | --- |
| a \`klein\`-named sub-folder of \`models/unet\` | \`models/unet/klein/flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8.safetensors\` |
| **any** sub-folder whose name contains \`klein\`, any capitalisation or spacing | \`models/unet/Flux2 Klein/…safetensors\` |
| the **top level** of \`models/unet\` | \`models/unet/flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8.safetensors\` |
| the same three, under \`models/diffusion_models\` | \`models/diffusion_models/flux2-klein-9b/…safetensors\` |
| any root declared in your \`extra_model_paths.yaml\` | a Stability Matrix / portable / A1111-shared tree |
| a relocated models folder | **Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI models folder** |

**The one limit:** the model has to be *nameable* as Klein — either the **file
name** or its **sub-folder name** must contain \`klein\`. A file called
\`model.safetensors\` sitting loose in \`diffusion_models/\` is invisible; put it in
a \`klein/\` folder (any file name then works) or rename the file. That rule is
what stops another family's checkpoint being wired into the Klein graph.

Every row of that table is covered by
\`backend/tests/test_klein_model_locations_documented.py\`, so it cannot quietly
stop being true.

*(Reported by CyberTod on Reddit, who duplicated the weights and built a symlink
to reclaim the disk space — neither was necessary.)*

### "On disk but cannot be loaded"

A \`.safetensors\` file declares the length of its JSON header in its first eight
bytes. A download that was **cut short or corrupted** leaves a file that is
shorter than it claims — plausible size, right name, right folder, and no loader
can open it. A licence or login page saved as \`.safetensors\` fails the same way.

Setup used to tick these as **✓ Installed** (the file existed) while the
generation page refused the engine. It now shows **⚠ On disk, unreadable** with
the file name and the reason, and **↻ Download again** replaces the bad file
instead of reporting "already present" and doing nothing.

If you placed the file by hand somewhere other than the folder Setup downloads
into, delete it yourself first — the app only replaces files at its own path.

*(Reported by zigzag4794 on Discord.)*

### "Not checked" is not "ready"

With ComfyUI stopped, the checks that need it cannot run, and the app reports no
gap rather than inventing one. Your files being on disk is therefore **not** a
clean bill of health, and Setup says so instead of showing a tick it did not
earn. Start ComfyUI and re-check.

## "Upscale & improve" makes my anime look realistic

**Why:** the improve pass sends Klein a fixed instruction, and the shipped one is
a *photographic* recipe — \`add detailed texture, add sharp details, add candid
shot, add soft focus effect\`. It is applied to every dataset, drawn ones
included, so on anime or illustration it does exactly what it says: it adds skin
texture and photo micro-detail your line art never had.

**Fix — two levers, both in Settings → Image engines → *Identity, Klein & Krea 2
prompts (advanced)*:**

1. **Rewrite the instruction.** The *Klein upscale & improve prompt* box holds
   the text in use; edit it to something that suits drawn art (e.g. "keep the
   drawn anime rendering, clean line art, flat cel shading, sharpen the lines").
   Clearing the box restores the shipped default — nothing is frozen.
2. **Or send no instruction at all.** The checkbox above the box — *Apply an
   improvement prompt on "Klein upscale & improve"* — turns it off, and the pass
   becomes a pure upscale.

Separately, **Settings → Image engines → *Upscale & improve — strength*** decides
how far the pass may move the image at all (output megapixels, sampler steps, the
enhancement LoRA, the consistency LoRA). Lower the *Enhancement LoRA* and raise
the *Consistency LoRA* if you want the pass to change less.

Both are now quoted and linked **from the ✨ Upscale & improve button itself** —
in the lightbox and in the grid's bulk toolbar — so the instruction currently in
force is readable where the action happens, and anime datasets get an explicit
warning there.

*(Reported by Qeeyana on Reddit.)*
## The browser opens "cannot connect" at startup

Fixed as of 2026-07-22 — update & restart if you still see it. The launcher
used to open a hardcoded \`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/\` *before* the server had
started, so any setup serving on a LAN or Tailscale \`server.host\` was greeted
with a dead tab every launch. It now opens the address the server is actually
bound to, only once the server accepts connections (with the access token
attached when the token gate is on). Don't want a tab at all — for example when
you only ever open the app from another device? Set \`LDS_NO_BROWSER=1\` before
launching.

## A Stop button doesn't seem to stop anything

As of 2026-07-22 every Stop in the app reports honestly instead of assuming:

- **Stop training** kills the training process and then *verifies it died*
  before saying so. If the process can't be confirmed dead within a few
  seconds you get an explicit error — retry the Stop, or check Task Manager
  for a wedged \`python\` process.
- **Stop generation** removes the queued renders immediately and asks ComfyUI
  to abort the one in flight. If ComfyUI is unreachable and can't confirm the
  abort, the app says the render *may still be running* rather than claiming
  success — the running render finishes on the GPU but its output is discarded.
- **Stop captioning** finishes the image currently being written, keeps
  everything captioned so far, and frees the GPU. The button reads
  "Stopping…" until that image completes (bounded by the per-image timeout).

If a Stop button is greyed out, another batch on the same dataset (for
example a caption pass) is holding the activity slot; it re-enables the
moment that batch ends.

## Stopping LoRA Dataset Studio

Closing the browser tab **never** stops the server — there is no
\`beforeunload\`, no keepalive, and no shutdown endpoint. The tab is just a
client. To stop the server on Windows:

1. **Ctrl+C** in the \`start.bat\` console — works on a fresh launch, and now
   also **after Settings ▸ Restart / Update & restart**. Those used to spawn
   the relaunched server in a *new* console window, leaving the original
   \`start.bat\` window holding a dead process; Ctrl+C there did nothing useful.
   \`start.bat\` is now a supervisor: a restart exits with code 3 and the same
   window relaunches the server, so Ctrl+C keeps working.
2. **\`stop.bat\`** (shipped next to \`start.bat\`) — the reliable stop when you
   are not at that console, or when an older restart left the server orphaned
   in another window. It:
   - resolves the port (\`LDS_PORT\` → \`config.json\` → \`5050\`);
   - asks the app to cancel its work (\`POST /api/system/stop-everything\`);
   - kills the listener's **process tree** (so infer children go with it);
   - sweeps leftovers whose executable path lives under this install
     (\`.venv\\\`, \`.python\\\`, \`data\\envs\\*\`) plus a recorded \`training_pid\` —
     never a blanket \`taskkill /IM python.exe\`, which would take out ComfyUI
     and anything else named \`python.exe\` on the machine;
   - **stops Ollama** (\`ollama.exe\` / \`ollama app.exe\`). State plainly: this
     stops **any** Ollama on the machine, including one you started by hand
     or share with another tool — the script cannot tell whose it is;
   - **leaves ComfyUI alone** (LDS never launches it) and reports if port
     8188 still answers;
   - confirms \`/api/health\` has gone silent, or says what is still alive.

Already down → \`stop.bat\` says so and exits cleanly.

The start.bat console also narrates the same events as the Activity panel
(see below) — pass start/finish, captions, queue, training — so you can watch
a long overnight run without opening the browser. Level is
\`console.level\` in \`config.json\` (default \`events\`; \`off\` / \`heartbeat\` /
\`all\` available); \`LDS_CONSOLE\` overrides it for a one-off launch.

## Is it stuck? — the Activity panel

Every long job in LDS has a progress bar, and every bar lives on the page that
owns it: a bank pass on that bank, a caption batch on that dataset, training on
Runs. So "is anything actually moving?" used to cost a tour of the app — and a
percentage cannot answer it anyway, because **a bar frozen at 34% and a bar that
will move again in two seconds are drawn identically**.

**📋 in the top bar** opens one panel that answers it, from any page:

- **Running now** — every live job across banks and datasets, with the **age of
  its last update**. That age is the whole point: a pass that reported two
  seconds ago is fine at 3%, and a pass that reported twelve minutes ago is
  stuck whatever its bar says. Past a minute of silence the row is flagged; past
  five it says *probably stuck*. Those thresholds are deliberately generous — a
  cold model load or a big folder walk can legitimately say nothing for a while,
  and a warning that cries wolf is one you stop reading.
- **The log** — a timestamped feed of passes starting, finishing, stopping and
  failing, plus the GPU being taken and released, caption batches, the bank
  queue and training. It appends as it arrives and never redraws, so scrolling
  up to read something does not yank you back down. The same events also print
  in the \`start.bat\` terminal (see [Stopping LoRA Dataset Studio](#stopping-lora-dataset-studio)).

The GPU lines are worth knowing about: taking the exclusive window unloads
ComfyUI and blocks training, and until now it did all of that with no visible
trace anywhere. If the panel says the GPU was taken and never released, that is
the *"GPU busy" when nothing is running* case below.

Two things this panel is **not**. It is not the server log — Settings ▸
Maintenance still tails that, and it is a developer artefact (Flask lines,
tracebacks, request noise); this one is the app's own account of its work, in
the words the UI uses. And it is **not kept across a restart**, because it
describes work that does not survive one either; a log full of jobs that are no
longer running would be a lie.

## "GPU busy" when nothing is running

Every GPU pass, every queued bank and every training start is gated on two
flags the app keeps: *training in progress* and *a vision/GPU pass in
progress*. They are set when work takes the card and cleared when it lets go.
If a process dies without letting go — ComfyUI gone, a borrowed Python that
never returned, a helper wedged on CUDA start-up — the flag stays set and
**everything afterwards refuses with a "GPU busy" that is not true**. The flag
has a timer, but it does not save you: an alive-but-stuck process keeps
refreshing it, so this used to mean restarting the app.

Two ways out, and the first is almost always the right one:

- **Clear the leftover flag.** Where the refusal appears — the bank workspace,
  the banks page, and Settings ▸ Maintenance — a warning shows up *only when
  the server has checked and found nothing behind the flag*, with a **Clear
  it — nothing is using the GPU** button. It stops nothing; it just corrects
  the app's belief. If something really is running you will not see it, and
  pressing it anyway is refused rather than allowed to break your own job.
- **⏹ Stop everything** (Settings ▸ Maintenance) when work *is* wedged. It
  cancels queued and running bank passes, dataset batches and in-flight
  generations, asks ComfyUI to unload, stops training, then clears the flags.
  It confirms first — it is destructive to in-flight work by design. Passes
  that cache their progress (✨ Score, 👥 Group by person) resume where they
  stopped; anything mid-flight is lost.

**It reports per target, and it does not round up.** An unreachable ComfyUI is
reported as *not confirmed*, not as stopped. A training process that cannot be
confirmed dead is a **failure**, and its flag is deliberately *not* cleared —
saying the GPU is free while a trainer still holds it is how two runs end up on
one card. So a result listing one failure alongside four successes is the report
working, not the button half-failing.

**The most common cause of this on a working install** is pointing ✨ Score at a
CUDA interpreter (see *Using the app → Make Score use a GPU Python you already
have*). That makes Score take the GPU exclusively, which is correct — but a
borrowed interpreter that stalls on CUDA start-up used to hold the flag
indefinitely. A helper that produces no output for 15 minutes is now stopped
automatically and the GPU released.

## Port 5000 conflict on macOS

macOS reserves port 5000 for AirPlay Receiver. Change the port in
**Settings → Server & access** (e.g. 5050) and restart.

## Garbled characters in the Windows console

Cosmetic only — some UTF-8 text renders wrong on the legacy console codepage.
The app itself is unaffected.

## \`npm install\` fails with \`Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-<platform>-...\`

Only relevant if you rebuild the frontend yourself (the repo ships \`dist/\`
prebuilt). It's a known npm bug: delete \`frontend/node_modules\` +
\`frontend/package-lock.json\` and run \`npm install\` again on this machine.
`,W=`# Getting help & reporting problems

Stuck, found a bug, or missing a feature? Two doors, both watched:

- **Discord** — [discord.gg/j6hnJBFtXE](https://discord.gg/j6hnJBFtXE) — ask in
  **#help**; usually the fastest way to get unstuck. Feature ideas and votes
  live in **#roadmap**.
- **GitHub** — [Issues](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/issues) —
  best for reproducible bugs and feature requests; the templates walk you
  through what to include.

## What makes a report solvable

The difference between a five-minute fix and a week of guessing is almost
always the same four things:

1. **Version** — shown in Settings → Maintenance → Updates ("Current build").
2. **Environment** — OS, and whether you run curation-only, full local, or Docker.
3. **What you did → what you expected → what happened** — three short lines
   beat three paragraphs.
4. **The log** — the last lines of the server log usually name the real error.
   Settings → Maintenance → 🪵 Server log → **Copy all**.

## Or let the app write it for you

The **diagnostic report** button below assembles all of that in one click:
version, OS, capability status, non-secret settings and the last log lines —
formatted, copied to your clipboard, ready to paste into Discord or a GitHub
issue.

What it deliberately **never** includes: your API keys or tokens (only
whether each one is set) and your folder paths (only whether each one is
configured). One caveat: the log tail can mention file names from your machine
— skim the paste before posting if that matters to you.

**If the copy does not happen:** browsers only give a page the clipboard on
HTTPS or on \`localhost\`, so opening the app from another machine — its LAN or
Tailscale address over plain http — means the copy is blocked no matter what
the app does. The report is still built: the button says so and drops the whole
thing into a box below it, already selected, so Ctrl/Cmd+C still gets you the
paste. Only a message that starts with *"Could not build the report"* means the
report itself failed.

## Feature requests

Describe the **job you were doing when you missed the feature** — the problem
is more valuable than the proposed solution. Post it in Discord **#roadmap** or
open a GitHub issue with the *Feature request* template.
