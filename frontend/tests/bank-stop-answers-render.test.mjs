/**
 * The Bank's Stop button, as it actually reaches the screen.
 *
 * Reported from a live 36 925-image bank, mid ✨ Score:
 *
 *   Scoring pass running — 2200 / 36925 · writing 36925 score(s) to the
 *   database… — a few minutes on a bank this size          [ Stop ]
 *
 *   "the Stop button at that point works very badly."
 *
 * Measured on that instance while the pass was writing: `POST /cancel` answered
 * in 79 ms — it touches no database at all — while `GET /api/bank/<id>`, the
 * banner's own source, took 2 745 ms. So the click landed instantly and the
 * screen could not show it for three seconds. The log holds SEVEN cancel POSTs
 * inside 20 ms.
 *
 * The unit tests next to `passStop.js` pin the decisions; these pin what a
 * reader SEES, which no source-text assertion can reach: the button's own
 * label, the `disabled` attribute, and which of the two sentences is on screen.
