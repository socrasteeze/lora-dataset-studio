/**
 * MOVING THROUGH A DATASET WITHOUT CLOSING THE IMAGE.
 *
 * The lightbox had no ⟨ / ⟩: reviewing image 41 of 340 meant closing it, finding
 * tile 42 on the wall, and opening that. This pins the three decisions that make
 * such a navigation safe rather than merely present:
 *
 *  1. it walks the list the grid SHOWS (filtered, sorted), so ⟩ never lands on a
 *     picture the current filters hide;
 *  2. per-image state — zoom, the comparison pane, "improving" — does NOT travel
 *     with the move. A comparison pane captioned "original" still showing the
 *     PREVIOUS image's parent is the failure this feature could ship;
 *  3. an end of the list is a disabled button that SAYS which end, in both the
 *     title and the aria-label — not a mute no-op, and not a silent wrap.
 *
 * The UI assertions are on the RENDERED markup, not on the .jsx source: whether
 * an arrow survives the props it is computed from is exactly what a regex over
 * the file cannot answer, and the props are handed down through two components.
