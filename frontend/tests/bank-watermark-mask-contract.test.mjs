/* 🚩 Bank watermark mask — wiring contract (node --test cannot parse JSX, so the
 * properties that would silently un-ship the feature are asserted as text).
 *
 * Reported by Qeeyana (Reddit). The risk this file guards is NOT "the dialog
 * renders": it is the Bank quietly growing its own second mask editor, and the
 * mask being drawn in a coordinate space the cleaner does not use.
