/* The caption engine has to be visible WHERE THE RESULT IS, not only in Settings.
 *
 * `captioning.backend` defaults to 'auto', which chains JoyCaption and the Ollama
 * vision model — two different writing styles, switched between without a word. The
 * Settings copy describes the INTENT; nothing described the run. So the backend now
 * counts who wrote each stored caption and the caption route returns it, and the two
 * surfaces that show a caption result have to actually use it: the toast that reports
 * the pass, and a line under the caption buttons that survives the toast.
 *
 * Read as SOURCE, and the limitation is stated rather than hidden: DatasetWorkspace
 * and useDataset cannot be mounted here without a dataset payload, a jobs context and
 * a capabilities provider that fetches. What this pins is the WIRING — that the
 * response field reaches both surfaces and is scoped to the right dataset. The
 * wording itself is rendered from utils/captionEngines.js, which IS executed, by
 * src/utils/captionEngines.test.js.
