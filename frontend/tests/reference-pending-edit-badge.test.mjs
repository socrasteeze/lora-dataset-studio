 * A reference edit is a PAID call. When one lands, the server now keeps it
 * across a restart — but the ✦ Edit modal only opens on a click, so the restored
 * result was reachable and never announced: the user had no way to learn it was
 * there, and the TTL deleted it half an hour later. The recovery is only worth
 * what the user can SEE, which is what these assertions pin. */
