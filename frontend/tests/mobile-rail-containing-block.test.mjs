/**
 * Contract test for the mobile chip rails — the `relative` that keeps a phone
 * layout full-width.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS. Reported from a phone: every bar on the dataset page drew
 * at roughly 73% of the screen, header included, with dead black space down the
 * right-hand side. Nothing looked broken up close — no clipped text, no visible
 * element sticking out — because the thing sticking out was one pixel wide and
 * deliberately invisible.
 *
 * `overflow-x-auto` clips a descendant only when the scroller is ALSO that
 * descendant's containing block, and a `position: static` box never is. The
 * section chips carry a NavBadge whose count is spelled out for screen readers
 * in a `.sr-only` span — which Tailwind implements as `position: absolute` with
 * no `top`/`left`. With no positioned ancestor it resolves against the document
 * and keeps its STATIC position: out at the far end of a rail 1123 px wide.
 * Measured on the reported page, that put the document at 598 px against a
 * 440 px viewport, so mobile Safari shrank the page to fit — 440/598 ≈ 73.6%,
 * exactly the ratio in the screenshot.
 *
 * One word on the scroller fixes it, and no test that renders nothing can feel
 * the difference: node --test cannot parse JSX and there is no layout engine
 * here, so this file greps the rails for the class. That is the whole defence —
 * a "tidy the classNames" pass that drops `relative` reintroduces a bug whose
 * symptom appears nowhere near the code that caused it.
