/**
 * Contract of 🎛 CFG/steps in the MULTI-LoRA branch of the Test Studio.
 *
 * Reported: "I cannot set the number of steps when I have two LoRAs selected, in
 * blend or in comparison." The field was not disabled — it did not exist, in the
 * one branch of the app that had no per-dataset payload to read the ladders from.
 * The end-to-end proof (non-default steps in the workflow ComfyUI receives, in
 * both modes) is backend/tests/test_studio_multilora_steps.py; the rule is
 * unit-tested in src/components/dataset/studio/studioAxes.test.js.
 *
 * What only the sources can say is asserted here.
