/* SeedVR2 settings — every dial reaches the user, or it does not exist.
 *
 * Requested by SurpassHR (GitHub #32) alongside the engine: "DiT/VAE model
 * locations, target resolution, batch size, etc.". A setting that lives in
 * config.py and nowhere else is invisible; one with no Guide entry is
 * undocumented; one with no help topic cannot be found by search. This test
 * pins the four surfaces together so the next dial cannot ship half-wired.
 *
 * node --test parses no JSX, so the card is read as TEXT — which is exactly the
 * granularity that matters here: the ids, the config keys and the reset targets.
