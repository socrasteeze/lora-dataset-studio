/**
 * What the user SEES while a bank pass works, and before one starts. Rendered.
 *
 * Two symptoms, both reported from a real 50 397-image bank, both invisible to
 * a source-text test:
 *
 *  · ✨ Score sat on "Scoring pass running — 373 / 373 · resuming — 20847 of
 *    21220 already cached" with a full bar for ~4 minutes while the parent wrote
 *    21 000 rows and the child grouped 25 000 embeddings. The pass was working;
 *    the screen said it had finished. What is pinned here is that a step with no
 *    counter takes the sentence AND drops the stale figure — "373 / 373 ·
 *    grouping styles" would read exactly as badly as before.
 *  · 🎨 Classify medium offered "Classify 2 images" on a scope whose two images
 *    had never been scored, then reported "0 classified". The window now counts
 *    the images it cannot answer for, and refuses the run.
