/**
 * MOUNT a real component in `node --test`. The thing this suite did not have.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every canvas test until now read its component as TEXT and matched regexes
 * against it. That catches a missing attribute; it cannot catch anything the
 * renderer would do, because nothing ever ran the renderer. Twice now that gap
 * has shipped a white screen: a dependency array read before its declaration,
 * and — the reason this file exists — a `barH` left behind in
 * `CanvasImageGroup` when the title bar moved out to `CanvasGroupBar` and took
 * the `const barH = groupBarHeight(...)` with it. Both files parsed. Both
 * passed a full green suite. Both threw `ReferenceError` on a user's board, in
 * production, on the first gesture that reached the faulty branch.
 *
 * A source-text test cannot see that. Executing the component sees it in one
 * line, so a component's render is now something a test can hold on to.
 *
 * ── How ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two module hooks, no new dependency and no browser:
 *
 *   · RESOLVE — the sources import `'./CanvasImageNode'` with no extension,
 *     which Vite resolves and Node does not. The hook retries the specifier
 *     with the same extension list Vite uses.
 *   · LOAD — `.jsx` is handed to esbuild (`jsx: 'automatic'`), which is exactly
 *     what Vite does to the same file at build time.
 *
 * Rendering is `react-dom/server`'s `renderToStaticMarkup`: it EXECUTES the
 * component function and every child, synchronously, with no DOM at all — so a
 * ReferenceError in any branch reached becomes a thrown test.
 *
 * ⚠️ What this does NOT do, said plainly so nobody reads more into a green run:
 * effects never run (`useEffect` is a no-op server-side), there is no layout,
 * no event ever fires, and nothing is measured. It answers exactly one
 * question — "does rendering this component, in this state, throw?" — which is
 * the question production kept answering for us.
 *
 * ⚠️ And it only covers the STATES a test passes it. `dropHint === 'leaving'`
 * shipped broken because no test had ever asked for that prop; rendering the
 * default state alone would have stayed green through the crash.
