/**
 * Contract for ✨ Score's two intents.
 *
 * The trap this pins is a repeat of one already made on the neighbouring pass:
 * "make the pass resume" reads like "hand it only the unscored images", and the
 * button that used to mean "do the whole bank" then becomes a no-op that still
 * reports a success. Here it would be worse than a no-op, because the style
 * cluster ids are ONE numbering of the whole bank — a pass over a subset would
 * restart them at 1 and land them on unrelated groups already stored.
 *
 * So three things are pinned, across both sides of the wire:
 *   • ✨ Score keeps posting an EMPTY body — it never silently re-scores;
 *   • the recompute-everything intent is a SEPARATE, explicit button, offered
 *     only when there is something to recompute (same shape as "Rescan all");
 *   • the server's pool stays "every non-rejected image", with no
 *     "already scored" filter anywhere near it.
