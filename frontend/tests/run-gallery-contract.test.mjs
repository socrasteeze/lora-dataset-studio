/* 🖼 The run gallery's JSX contract — read as text, because `node --test` cannot
   parse JSX and every guarantee below is a rewrite away from being lost without
   anything throwing:

     • the board opens the RUN panel on a card click, through the tested
       decision helper (so the drag guard cannot be bypassed by an inline `&&`);
     • the pill click still opens its CHECKPOINT gallery — the new gesture is an
       addition, not a replacement;
     • there is exactly ONE gallery panel component. A second one would be a
       second grid over the same rows and a second delete to keep honest;
     • the run panel groups, folds, and states its notes, its settings and what
       it is not showing.
