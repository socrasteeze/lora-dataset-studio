/**
 * 🖼 A picture parked OUTSIDE its lane must render, and must render where it
 * was put.
 *
 * The board used to floor a pinned image's coordinates at zero, so its own
 * lane's top-left corner was a wall: a render could be dragged down and right
 * for ever and never up or left. Removing that wall is a one-line change in
 * `clampImageBox`, and one-line changes to geometry are exactly the kind that
 * pass a green suite and then draw nothing — a negative `left` swallowed by a
 * parent that clips, a NaN in a style, a member of a strip laid out from an
 * anchor that is now above the origin.
 *
 * So this file EXECUTES the components (tests/support/mountJsx.mjs) with the
 * coordinates free placement produces, instead of asserting on the arithmetic
 * that feeds them — the arithmetic is already covered next door in
 * src/utils/canvasImageNodes.test.js, and it was never the half that shipped
 * broken.
