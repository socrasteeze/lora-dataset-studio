/**
 * 🖼🖼 A group of pinned images must stay MOVABLE and CLOSABLE.
 *
 * The bug this pins down: a group's title bar is drawn on board space ABOVE its
 * own strip, and `LaneImages` renders its entries as absolutely-positioned
 * siblings with no z-index. As an ordinary descendant of the strip, the bar was
 * therefore painted over by any picture the board placed on that space — and it
 * carries ALL THREE of a group's affordances, so one picture above a strip left
 * it impossible to move, to export AND to close at once.
 *
 * Measured on the real DOM before the fix: a picture pinned flush above a
 * two-image strip made 5 of 11 points sampled along the bar hand the pointer to
 * the picture instead of the bar.
 *
 * Two halves, both asserted here without a browser:
 *   · RENDER ORDER — the bars are a layer drawn after every picture and strip;
 *   · PLACEMENT — the placers know the bar occupies board space, so ✦ Tidy up
 *     and 📌 Pin all cannot create the overlap on their own.
