/**
 * 🎬 The video lane, RENDERED — the constraints that only a real render can pin.
 *
 * Three of the four assertions here cannot be made any other way:
 *
 *  · THE GRID CONTAINS NO <video>. That is the load-bearing design decision of
 *    the whole lane, and the "nicer" version someone will eventually write — a
 *    muted <video preload="none"> per tile, played on hover — is broken in two
 *    ways that never show up in review. There is no clip FILE to hover (a bank
 *    stores bounds and encodes nothing until promotion), and Chrome caps
 *    WebMediaPlayers at roughly sixty across the browser: past that, new
 *    elements simply never load, with no error of any kind. A bank holds
 *    hundreds of shots, so the failure would land on someone else's second
 *    screen of scroll. Counting the elements in the rendered markup is the only
 *    check that survives a rewrite of the component.
 *
 *  · THE LIGHTBOX CONTAINS EXACTLY ONE, pointed at the SOURCE with a media
 *    fragment. A missing `#t=` does not throw and does not warn — the browser
 *    ignores it and plays the whole file, which on a two-hour rush is the worst
 *    outcome available.
 *
 *  · THE TARGET PICKER SHOWS `licence_note` AND `training_verified`. Both are
 *    what stop a wasted week, and both are the kind of label a tidy-up quietly
 *    removes. The strings are asserted against the real catalogue's own wording.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file MOUNTS components, so it needs `frontend/node_modules` (react +
 * esbuild). Git worktrees of this repo do not have one — there it fails with
 * `Cannot find package 'react'`, exactly like the canvas render tests, and that
 * is a missing dependency rather than a regression.
