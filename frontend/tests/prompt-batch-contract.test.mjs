/**
 * Contract of 📝 the prompt batch — tick several saved prompts, launch once.
 *
 * The rule itself is unit-tested next to it
 * (src/components/dataset/studio/promptBatch.test.js) and the "N prompts → N
 * distinct workflows" proof lives in backend/tests/test_studio_prompt_batch.py.
 * What is asserted HERE is what only the sources can say, because `node --test`
 * cannot parse JSX:
 *
 *   · the feature exists on BOTH generation surfaces by construction — one
 *     history component, mounted through one RunSetupPanel, so the Test Studio
 *     and the board cannot ship one without the other;
 *   · the batch reaches BOTH launch routes: the key travels in the object each
 *     hook spreads into its POST body, and both hooks really spread it;
 *   · ticking nothing changes nothing (no key, no multiplier, same label);
 *   · what the batch costs is announced BEFORE the click, in the counter and on
 *     the button — the failure mode here is a panel that says "1 image" and a
 *     queue that receives nine.
