/* Contract: the network layer stays quiet about background polls, the toast
 * queue merges repeats, and the offline state is rendered somewhere.
 *
 * These are source assertions on purpose. The logic itself is unit-tested
 * (utils/toastQueue.test.js, utils/connectionStatus.test.js,
 * components/bank/progressPresence.test.js) — what THIS file protects is the
 * WIRING, which lives in JSX `node --test` cannot execute. A rewrite of
 * Toast.jsx that quietly goes back to `[...prev, toast]` would pass every unit
 * test and re-ship the ten stacked banners.
