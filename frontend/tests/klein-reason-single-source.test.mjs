/* ⚠ One engine, one answer to "why not".
 *
 * `utils/localEngineReason.js` exists because a second inline copy of a reason is
 * how "⚠ Configure ComfyUI in Settings" ends up worded one way in one dialog and
 * another way two clicks later, for the same missing file. The generation picker
 * and the ✦ Edit modal read it. FOUR watermark surfaces and the concept scraper
 * did not: they each carried a hand-written catch-all —
 *
 *     "Klein inpainting needs ComfyUI running + the Klein models (Setup ▸ ComfyUI)"
 *     "Klein is not ready in this setup."
 *
 * — which names no cause at all. It is the same defect the Setup screen had (a ✓
 * posted without checking), pointed the other way: a refusal stated without a
 * reason. Worse, it is confidently WRONG in the case that actually happens — a
 * present-but-corrupted 9.5 GB weight sends the user off to re-check ComfyUI and
 * re-download files that are already there.
 *
 * Read as text: `node --test` cannot parse JSX, and nothing throws when a screen
 * quietly grows its own sentence again.
