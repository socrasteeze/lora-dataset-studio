/**
 * The fp8 quantize tool has TWO doors and must stay ONE implementation.
 *
 * It shipped reachable from a single place: the bottom of a dataset's ordinary
 * Training panel, which only exists once you have a dataset. Someone who
 * downloaded a 26 GB model from Hugging Face — the person the tool was written
 * for — has no dataset and never saw it. Settings ▸ Storage is the second door.
 *
 * The failure this file exists to prevent is not "the card is missing": it is
 * the SECOND implementation. Copying the JSX into StorageSection would look
 * identical on the day it lands and would then drift — the refusals (already
 * quantized, LoRA, overwriting the source) and the read-back verification live
 * in the component, so a copy is a second set of them. So the source assertions
 * below pin that exactly one file talks to the endpoints, and the mount
 * assertions pin that BOTH hosts render the real thing rather than a lookalike.
 *
 * This fork does not carry upstream's HfStorageCard (Divergence 4: no Hugging
 * Face storage forecast, no cloud-quantize third door) — the Settings door
 * therefore mounts cleanly without a ToastProvider workaround for a sibling
 * this fork does not have. The ToastProvider wrap stays anyway: StorageSection
 * itself renders inside one in the real app, and mounting it bare is not the
 * same test as mounting it the way the app actually does.
