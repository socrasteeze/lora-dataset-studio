"""Repair dependency installs that are unsafe to import.

The in-app updater -- or a partial ML-extras install that downgrades Pillow to
satisfy a pillow<10 dependency -- can leave Pillow HALF-swapped on Windows: the
core (``Image.py``) at one version while an image plugin is at another. Pillow 12's
``Image.mode`` is a read-only property, so an old plugin that still does
``self.mode = ...`` raises ``property 'mode' has no setter`` the first time it
decodes an image (e.g. PngImagePlugin).

Detect that mix by INSPECTING THE FILES ON DISK, never by trusting pip's metadata:
a rolled-back / interrupted downgrade leaves the ``.dist-info`` reading an OLDER
version than ``Image.py`` actually is, and the previous metadata-gated check
(``version < 12 -> assume fine``) returned early and MISSED exactly that case. The
decision is made from the relationship between ``Image.py`` (read-only ``mode``
property?) and the plugins (``self.mode =``?) -- independent of the version string.
The caller reports the mix. This module does not run pip.

``importlib.metadata`` + plain file reads only: importing PIL here would lock its
binaries on Windows and recreate the very failure this bootstrap is meant to fix.
