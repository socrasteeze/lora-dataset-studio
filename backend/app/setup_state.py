"""Remembering that an install was already checked out fine, so coming back to
the app does not mean sitting through Setup again.

The Setup wizard is a FIRST-RUN experience, but nothing recorded that the first
run had happened: the onboarding redirect keyed off a per-tab sessionStorage
flag, so every new tab / browser session re-offered Setup on a machine that had
been working for weeks. That is the redundancy this module removes.

Three independent signals:

  completed — the user opened the core workspace and its setup state was saved.
              No plugin or image engine is required for this durable choice.

  verified  — this install was once observed working (configured + at least one
              image engine ready). Persisted in the data dir, so it survives a
              new tab, a new browser, a server restart, and a second machine on
              the LAN. Never expires: an install does not become un-set-up.

  checks    — a HIGH-WATER MARK of what this install has proven it can do
              (`_STATIC_TRACKED` below). A re-check compares the live probe against it
              and reports what STOPPED working — a regression is a real failure
              worth interrupting for, whereas "not everything is installed" is
              the normal state of almost every install and must never nag.

Only DURABLE signals are tracked. Whether ComfyUI or Ollama happens to be
running right now is not a setup failure — those are started on demand and go
dark a dozen times a day; treating them as regressions would turn this into the
exact nag it exists to remove. See _STATIC_TRACKED / the module docstring of
capabilities.py for the full published surface.

Nothing here is a user SETTING: it is app state the user never edits, so it
lives in its own small file rather than in config.json.
