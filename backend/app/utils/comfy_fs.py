"""The FILESYSTEM half of the ComfyUI contract — and what to say when it breaks.

The app talks to ComfyUI over TWO channels, and only one of them is the network:

1. the HTTP API (`comfyui.api_url`) — what the Setup wizard tests;
2. the FILESYSTEM — every local engine copies its source image into ComfyUI's
   `input/` folder and reads the render back from `output/` (the read side already
   degrades to `GET /view`; the write side has no fallback).

A ComfyUI that answers on its URL therefore proves nothing about channel 2. When
ComfyUI runs in another container, in WSL, or on another machine, `input/` is not
shared by default: the copy lands somewhere ComfyUI cannot see, or fails outright
with an OSError that no route maps — a bare 500 with no detail (reported on
Discord by nofaceman).

This module makes that failure SPEAK. Every staged write goes through
`stage_input_copy` / `stage_input_write`, which name the operation, the folder and
the plausible cause, and raise `ComfyFolderUnavailable` (a RuntimeError, so the
existing route mapping answers 409 + message instead of 500 + nothing).

Every message is PASTE-SAFE: paths run through `redact_user_paths`, because these
strings are written to be dropped into a public help thread.

# 0.67 GB, from 17/04 to the day of writing — and the count is also what ComfyUI
# enumerates for LoadImage on every prompt validation.
#

# the safety net for what precise deletion cannot reach: the files already
# orphaned before this existed, and any job whose process died before completing.
#

# fenced THREE times over and each fence is independently sufficient to spare a
# file we have no business touching:
#
#  1. NAME. Not a loose prefix — a full match on the exact shape the staging code
#     mints, `<lane>_<8 hex uid>_<original name>`. A user's own `edit_reference.png`
#     or `krea_sources.png` does not match; nothing without one of our uids does.
#  2. AGE. Nothing younger than STAGED_INPUT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS, which is set above
#     the longest a staged copy can legitimately still be waiting for its job.
#  3. LIVE JOBS. The caller passes the names every non-terminal queue row still
