# backend/app/utils/comfyui.py
"""ComfyUI communication, workflow helpers, and model/LoRA discovery.

Lifted from the parent project's app/utils/comfyui.py (1878 lines) for LoRA
Dataset Studio, config-driven and slimmed:

  - The module-level COMFYUI_LORA_DIR / COMFYUI_OUTPUT_DIR / COMFYUI_API_ADDRESS
    constants become live accessors (`_lora_dir()`, `_out_dir()`, `api_address()`)
    that re-read `app.config` on every call, so editing config.json takes effect
    without a restart. Every lister degrades to `[]` (never raises) when ComfyUI
    isn't configured yet.
  - hidden_models/hidden_loras visibility filtering dropped (single-user app —
    nothing to hide).
  - Video/other-app listers dropped: `get_subtle_loras`, `get_klein_loras`
    (unused by klein_edit_helper, the only prospective caller — it only needs
    `load_workflow_local` + `get_flux2_klein_models`), `get_ltx_camera_loras`,
    `get_wan_video_loras`, `get_biglove_models` (duplicate of
    `get_checkpoint_models`, folded away), `get_krea_style_loras`.
  - Also dropped (no caller in this app): `configure_http_notify_node` /
    `check_comfyui_dependencies` (the video webhook-notify flow this app's
    polling-based job_queue doesn't use), `get_comfyui_queue_status`,
    `invalidate_model_caches`, `get_model_folder_paths`, `unload_ollama_model`.

# SDXL model previously produced under-cooked images.

#                  somebody, and wrong for exactly the people with the richest
#                  ComfyUI. Fixed below.
#   /prompt (10s)  request is the graph, response is one id. Size is bounded by
#                  OUR workflow, not by the user's install. Also a WRITE: a longer
#                  budget on a retry-capable path buys duplicate submissions, not
#                  reliability.
#   /history/<id>  one prompt's outputs. Bounded.
#   /queue, /interrupt, /free   constant-size control calls.
#   /view (60s, streamed)       an image download; already generous.
#   capabilities._http_ok on /history (3s)  the reachability VERDICT. It has to
#                  stay snappy — it runs on every capability poll and gates the
#                  whole UI. Its problem was never the number, it was that a
#                  3 s miss was reported as "ComfyUI isn't running"; it now asks
#                  this probe (the one that waited long enough to know) instead.
#
# So: one honest knob, not five guessed ones.
# Two DIFFERENT budgets, because "ComfyUI is off" and "ComfyUI is slow" are two
# different failures and one number cannot serve both:
#
#   * CONNECT — how long we wait for the TCP handshake. A ComfyUI that isn't
#     running refuses the connection instantly on loopback, and a wrong host /
#     firewalled port fails here. This is the ONLY budget an absent ComfyUI ever
#     pays, which is what makes the read budget below safe to make generous: the
#     old single 8 s number had to be small *because* it was also the price of a
#     stopped ComfyUI. Splitting them removes that trade-off entirely.
#   * READ — how long ComfyUI may spend BUILDING the answer once it has accepted
#     the connection. This is the number that has to scale with the install: the
#     /object_info payload lists every node class and every model file, so it
#     grows with the custom-node packs and the weights the user has installed.

      * 'gguf'  — a `.gguf` model handed to a CORE loader. Core ComfyUI does not

        no folder will ever help. The app itself lists `.gguf` in its pickers

      * 'not_listed' — the name exists on the disk the APP scanned but not in the
        list the ComfyUI answering on the port serves. The app lists models with
        os.listdir; ComfyUI serves them from wherever its own process was

        declares a shared root AND its install-directory root — those two lists
        disagree by construction, and no amount of copying reconciles them.

    Extension first: a `.gguf` is reported as such even when some pack DOES list
    it, because our graphs emit core loaders and would fail regardless.

    FAIL-OPEN in both directions, exactly like the enum check:
      * probe unreachable (`files` is None) -> [] — never block a working install;
      * class_type absent from /object_info -> skipped, because that is a MISSING

    before anyone is allowed to kill a job over them.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (reported in #help, 2026-08-08): "there is a delay after
    deploying a new checkpoint from Canvas before LDS can use it — even though I
    can clearly select the deployed LoRA inside Comfy". Both halves were true.
    `_fetch_object_info` serves a snapshot for `_OBJECT_INFO_TTL` (60 s) and the
    deploy path does not invalidate it, so a model deployed at t+0 was judged
    against the list as it stood at t-59. The refusal that followed is
    DETERMINISTIC (`WORKFLOW_INVALIDE`, never retried — job_queue), so the job was
    killed for good, and the message sent the user to check an API address that was
    correct all along. A deterministic verdict may not rest on a stale observation:
    that is the whole content of this function.

    Re-asking WORKS, which is the fact that makes this the right fix rather than a
    hopeful one. ComfyUI answers `/object_info` from `folder_paths.get_filename_list`,
    whose cache is invalidated by the mtime of every scanned directory INCLUDING
    subdirectories (`recursive_search` records one entry per subdir), so a file
    dropped into `loras/<sub>/` invalidates it. Its second, mtime-blind cache
    (`CacheHelper`) is activated only for the duration of one `/object_info` request
    and cleared on exit — a within-request dedup, not a cross-request cache.

    COST — one extra `/object_info` in the worst case, and it cannot run away:
      * only reached when a graph is about to be REFUSED, never on a healthy queue;
      * never for `gguf`, which is definitive whatever any list says;
      * skipped when the snapshot is already younger than
        `_OBJECT_INFO_RECHECK_MAX_AGE`, which is what bounds a batch: the forced
        probe refreshes the cache, so a grid of N tiles against a genuinely missing
        model pays one probe per 5 s, not one per tile — and since the probe itself
        takes seconds on the installs where it is expensive, it throttles itself.

    Fails OPEN when the fresh probe fails: with no current evidence the honest move
    is to hand the graph to ComfyUI, whose own 400 is ground truth and is already
    handled. `gguf` items survive that, because no probe was ever their basis.

    Returns the workflow too: a name confirmed present is re-spelled against the
    FRESH list (`canonical_model_widgets`), because the spelling the graph carries
    was resolved against the stale one and ComfyUI validates by exact string.

    The third value is `fresh`: True when the surviving verdict rests on an
    observation no older than `_OBJECT_INFO_RECHECK_MAX_AGE` — either one we just
    forced, or one already that young. It is what earns the message the right to

    on Windows, but 'sam3.1_…' stays at the root.

    Without this the loader rejects the prompt (400 'value_not_in_list'). Names that
    already contain a separator (already a relative path) keep their segments;
    unknown names — or an unconfigured ComfyUI output dir — fall back to themselves.

    The separator is the one of the tree we WALKED (os.sep), never a hardcoded
    backslash: it used to be, and on Linux that made every subfoldered checkpoint
    unloadable (GitHub #21, 1Tomber). `queue_prompt_to_comfyui` has the last word
    and respells this against the target install's published list.

    The walk covers every checkpoints root the PICKER lists from — the default

    offers all of them as bare basenames. Walking only the default tree meant a
    checkpoint in a SUBFOLDER of an extra root fell through to the bare-name
    fallback, the preflight then looked for models/checkpoints/<basename> and
    raised a 409 naming a path the file never lived at (GitHub #36, KingyWolf).

    ----------------------------------------------
    The directory-only rule made the app's OWN full-model output invisible here.
    The local fp8 quantize/merge tools write next to their source, which is often
    the ROOT of `diffusion_models` — that is a folder ComfyUI reads — so a file
    those tools just produced could not be picked as a Test Studio base. The only
    way to try it was to open ComfyUI by hand.

    That it was an oversight and not a rule is settled by the Generate surface:
    `krea_edit_helper._krea_unet_folders` has always matched 'krea' in the folder
    OR in the filename, root included. Aligning on it retro-fits every twin
    already on disk without moving a byte, and it borrows the same exclusion
    list — BigLove* carries 'krea' and renders pure noise under this pipeline.

    FLUX and Klein weights, and listing those as Krea bases would trade one
    silent wrong result for another."""
