"""Slim image job queue: a FIFO worker over `ImageGenerationQueue` plus a tiny
JSON key/value store (`SystemState`) used by lifted services for cross-request
flags (e.g. training locks, test-studio run state).

Replaces the source app's ~181 KB queue_manager. `_submit`/`_poll_outputs` are
the only two functions that talk to ComfyUI; both lazy-import
`app.utils.comfyui` (lifted in Task 13) so a missing/broken module fails the
job cleanly instead of crashing the worker thread. `_dispatch_completion`
lazy-imports the owning service (routing on job metadata) so this module never
imports the services that create jobs (avoids import cycles).

        (0.67 GB over three months on the install this was measured on), and a
        process killed mid-job leaves its copy behind whatever we do. Boot is the
        one moment when nothing is in flight, so an age-bounded sweep here is
        both safe and enough — no thread, no timer, no hot-path cost.

        The folder belongs to ComfyUI, so the sweep is fenced by NAME and by AGE
        (see comfy_fs) and, here, by the queue itself: every input a job that has
        not finished still points at is collected first and handed over as
        untouchable. Boot recovery has already preserved uncertain rows by the time
        this runs, so what is left really is work that will still be done."""

        """WHICH hold is keeping the worker off the GPU, as a stable key, or None.

        A key rather than a sentence because the two surfaces that ask word it
        differently and both are right: the improve drain says "waiting for X"
        inside a progress line, the queue dock writes a full sentence with a
        remedy. Sharing one string would have forced one of them to read badly —
        and picking a sentence written for a THIRD screen is how the dock ended
        up telling someone in the dataset workspace that "the studio is
        unavailable".

        The four conditions `process_one` checks before it looks at a single row,
        minus the fifth — 'a job is already running' — which is not a hold but the
        serialization working as designed. The one that matters most, the
        in-process vision window, is not visible in the DB flags at all: a caller
        that re-derived this from `_get_system_state` alone would miss exactly the
        case where the heartbeat lost ownership and the barrier outlived the flag.

        It exists because a caller outside this module cannot tell a paused queue
        from a slow one, and one that guessed got it wrong: the bulk improve drain
        counted every poll of a queue frozen by a training run against its own
        15-minute stall timeout, then declared itself stalled and silently dropped
        the rest of the batch. Waiting on a queue that is provably held is not a
        stall, it is waiting.
