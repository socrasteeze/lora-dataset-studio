"""Setup installer: run whitelisted, self-contained installs in a background
thread and expose their live state for polling. Actions:

  ml_extras          -> pip install -r backend/requirements-ml.txt (the app's own venv):
                        installs ALL the ML extras at once — kept for a first-time setup
  face_scoring       -> pip install JUST the face-scoring packages (insightface + onnx-
                        runtime, versions read from requirements-ml.txt) into the inter-
                        preter probe_face_scoring resolves — install/repair ONE feature
  masks              -> pip install JUST the person-mask package (rembg) into the inter-
                        preter probe_masks resolves — install/repair ONE feature
  watermark_inpaint  -> install the watermark-inpainting package (simple-lama-inpainting,
                        version floor read from requirements-ml.txt) into a dedicated
                        3.10-3.12 interpreter. When the user has configured one it is used;
                        otherwise the action AUTO-PROVISIONS one — finds a base Python
                        3.10-3.12, builds an isolated venv under the data dir, installs CPU
                        torch + simple-lama into it, and records it as watermark.python. No
                        manual venv, no setting to edit (the package needs Pillow<10 and can
                        never share the app's Pillow-12 venv)
  (face_scoring/masks/watermark_inpaint all follow the same shape: ML interpreter resolved
   per capability, requirements-ml.txt pinned as a -c constraint, probe cache invalidated
   on success so the capability flips without a restart.)
  ollama_model       -> stream Ollama's /api/pull for the configured vision model
  klein_model        -> download the Klein 9B (KV) fp8 diffusion model into
                        <ComfyUI>/models/unet/klein/ — a PUBLIC download (no token). The KV
                        build caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising
                        step, so multi-reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs
                        up to 2.5x faster at identical quality. A 401 still logs recovery
                        steps as a safety net (see license_url below)
  klein_lora         -> download the consistency LoRA into <ComfyUI>/models/loras/klein/
  klein_text_encoder -> qwen_3_8b_fp8mixed into <ComfyUI>/models/text_encoders/
  klein_vae          -> flux2-vae into <ComfyUI>/models/vae/
  krea_model         -> the Krea 2 Turbo base into <ComfyUI>/models/diffusion_models/krea/
  krea_text_encoder  -> qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled into <ComfyUI>/models/text_encoders/
  krea_vae           -> qwen_image_vae into <ComfyUI>/models/vae/
  krea_identity_lora -> the Krea 2 Identity Edit LoRA (Civitai) into
                        <ComfyUI>/models/loras/krea/
  krea_nodes         -> git clone (ZIP fallback) the comfyui-krea2edit custom-node pack
                        into <ComfyUI>/custom_nodes/ — the ONLY action that installs code
                        rather than weights, and the only one whose success still requires
                        the user to restart ComfyUI (nodes register at startup only)

No shell, no client-supplied arguments: each action's command/URL/destination is fixed.

Pip actions are SERIALIZED (one at a time, second request queued in click order): two
pip processes writing the same environment race on a shared package's dist-info and
corrupt it — proven by repro (two concurrent installs of one big binary package into
one venv fail 6/6 with WinError 2 / Errno 13). Each pip run also retries once on a
transient file-lock error (an antivirus holding a fresh file). Model downloads and the
ollama pull don't touch a venv, so they stay parallel.

# Fixed catalog of the Klein downloads (re-checked 2026-07-17): all four files are
# PUBLIC downloads. The default UNET is the KV-cache build (flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8):
# it caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising step, so multi-
# reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs up to 2.5x faster at
# identical quality — same VAE/text-encoder. Unlike the plain 9b-fp8 repo (which is
# license-gated → 401 without a token), the KV repo is NOT access-gated: HF serves it
# publicly (verified: API gated=false, resolve → public CDN). The FLUX Non-Commercial
# License still governs USE. `license_url` is kept so a future re-gating (or a stale
# token) still degrades into actionable recovery steps rather than a bare 401.
# `legacy_names` = earlier default filenames still accepted as "already installed",
# so an install that fetched the pre-KV model never re-downloads ~10 GB (both variants
# resolve by name at generate time — see klein_edit_helper.resolve_klein_unet).

# 📷 Camera angles — the weights that move the CAMERA rather than the subject.
#
# WHY A SECOND BASE MODEL AT ALL, when a 9 GB one is already installed. Measured
# on this repo's own Klein lane (2026-08-25, one reference, seed held constant):
# asked for a profile or a back view, Klein turns the PERSON and leaves the room
# exactly where it was — every phrasing tried, English, an explicit "only the
# photographer moves", the Chinese cinematography terms, with and without the
# one camera LoRA that exists for Klein 9B. The backdrop delta stayed at 11-14
# (noise) against 64-80 for a real viewpoint change. The Qwen LoRA below was
# trained on 3000+ gaussian-splatting renders — pairs where the subject cannot
# move and the background must — and reaches 64-80 on all eight angles tried.
# That inversion is the feature; it is not reachable by prompting harder.
#
# URL survey 2026-08-26 (anonymous HTTP HEAD, no token): all four answer 200 and
# the signed CDN URL carries `user_id=public` — none is access-gated. The
# 401/403 recovery path is kept anyway, like every other catalog here: a
# measurement is a photograph of one moment.
#
# NOT LISTED, on purpose: the Qwen image VAE. `krea_vae` above already installs
# the identical file to the identical destination — a second key for the same
# bytes would put the same gigabyte on the Setup screen twice and let two copies
# drift. services/qwen_camera_helper.CAMERA_VAE_ACTION names that button instead.
#
# `dest[0]` is 'diffusion_models' for the model and 'loras' for the adapters,

# Custom-node packs the app can install itself. The first git-cloned
# dependencies this app installs at all, so the rules are written down rather
# than implied:
#   * the URL is a CONSTANT here, never derived from user input, and the clone
#     runs as an argument list (no shell) with a timeout;
#   * the destination is <validated ComfyUI>/custom_nodes/<folder> — resolved
#     through the same capabilities.resolve_comfyui_base every other install
#     uses, and REFUSED (never guessed) when no valid ComfyUI is configured;
#   * an existing folder is left strictly alone (a user may have patched it);
#   * git may be absent (ZIP installs of ComfyUI have none), so a codeload ZIP
#     is the fallback — and if both fail the log says what to do by hand;
#   * ComfyUI only registers nodes at STARTUP, so a successful install reports
#     "restart ComfyUI", it never claims the engine is ready.

# WHY THE VIDEO STUDIO'S NODE PACKS ARE NOT HERE (maintainer's call, 2026-08-31)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "Downloading models is fine, but we do not take responsibility for breaking a
# ComfyUI install." A weight is an inert file in a models folder: worst case it
# is unused. A custom node is CODE that ComfyUI imports at startup, and one bad
# import takes the whole server down for every other lane the user has — a cost
# they did not agree to when they clicked a button in this app.
#
# So the three optional packs of the video lane (MiniMax-H3-Turbo,
# H3-Optimizations, MMH3-UltimateUpscale) and SageAttention (ComfyUI-KJNodes)
# are NAMED and LINKED by the studio, and installed by the user on the ComfyUI
# side, through ComfyUI-Manager or a clone. `video_test_studio.OPTION_NODE_PACKS`
# holds those links; nothing here fetches them.
#
# The two packs above (krea/lanpaint) predate that rule and keep their buttons —
# what changed is the direction, not a retrofit of somebody's working install.

# Node packs the app SHIPS (backend/comfy_nodes/<folder>), installed by COPY into
# the user's ComfyUI instead of fetched from a remote. See
# backend/comfy_nodes/README.md for the contract these folders sign.
#
# Why a second registry rather than a `local: True` flag on _NODE_PACKS: the two
# differ on the rule that matters most, which is what to do when the folder is
# already there. A third-party pack is LEFT ALONE (the user may have pinned a
# version of somebody else's code). Ours is OVERWRITTEN when the stamp inside it
# is not this app version — nobody pins ours, and a stale copy is how a user ends
# up running last month's sampler against this month's graph. One flag would have
# hidden an inverted rule inside a shared code path.

# scoped install can't bump numpy past insightface's <2 ABI ceiling. A dedicated
# test (test_no_orphan_ml_package) asserts EVERY line in requirements-ml.txt is
# owned by at least one capability below — a package added to the file but
# forgotten here would silently never be installed by any scoped action.
#
#   face_scoring  insightface (face embeddings) + onnxruntime (its runtime). numpy
#                 is pinned <2 *for insightface's* ABI; opencv-python-headless is
#                 the server-safe cv2 that insightface & rembg both pull — listed so
#                 the scoped install prefers the headless variant, matching the
#                 monolithic `-r` install.
#   masks         rembg (u2net background removal) + onnxruntime (the runtime it
#                 RUNS on), + the same shared numpy / headless-opencv floor.
#                 onnxruntime is listed EXPLICITLY, not via a `rembg[cpu]` extra:
#                 rembg ≥2.0.50 imports onnxruntime at module load but stopped
#                 declaring it, so a scoped masks install resolved every package
#                 it knew about, reported success, and left `import rembg` dying
#                 on ModuleNotFoundError — the capability stayed ✗ with no reason
#                 shown (issue #24, 1Tomber). The explicit name is the durable
#                 choice: the `[cpu]`/`[gpu]` extras did not exist before 2.0.50
#                 and would silently resolve to nothing on an older pin, while
#                 the plain name is pinned once in requirements-ml.txt like every
#                 other ML package. _drop_provided_onnxruntime() below keeps it
#                 from stepping on a GPU build the user already has.
#   watermark_inpaint  simple-lama-inpainting (has its own dedicated worker below;
#                 listed here only so the anti-orphan test sees its package covered).
#   wd14          the 🏷️ WD14 tagger: onnxruntime (it IS an ONNX model) + numpy +
#                 headless opencv for decode/resize. NO new package — every one of
#                 the three is already pinned in requirements-ml.txt for
#                 face_scoring/masks, so a machine with either of those installed
#                 needs no pip work at all here (_drop_provided_onnxruntime also
#                 keeps this from stepping on a GPU onnxruntime build). Pillow is
#                 deliberately NOT used by the child: a dedicated ML env need not
#                 have it, and cv2.imdecode over bytes we read ourselves is also
#                 the unicode-path-safe way in (cv2.imread cannot open one on
#                 Windows). The ~400 MB of WEIGHTS are not a pip concern — the
#                 child fetches those on first run (see services/wd14_tagger.py).
