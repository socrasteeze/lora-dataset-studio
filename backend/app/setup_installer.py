"""Setup installer: run whitelisted, self-contained installs in a background
thread and expose their live state for polling. Actions:

  ml_extras          -> pip install -r backend/requirements-ml.txt (the app's own venv):
                        installs ALL the ML extras at once — kept for a first-time setup
  face_scoring       -> pip install JUST the face-scoring packages (insightface + onnx-
                        runtime, versions read from requirements-ml.txt) into the inter-
                        preter probe_face_scoring resolves — install/repair ONE feature
  masks              -> pip install JUST the person-mask package (rembg) into the inter-
                        preter probe_masks resolves — install/repair ONE feature
  watermark_inpaint  -> install the watermark-inpainting package (simple-lama-inpainting,
                        version floor read from requirements-ml.txt) into a dedicated
                        3.10-3.12 interpreter. When the user has configured one it is used;
                        otherwise the action AUTO-PROVISIONS one — finds a base Python
                        3.10-3.12, builds an isolated venv under the data dir, installs CPU
                        torch + simple-lama into it, and records it as watermark.python. No
                        manual venv, no setting to edit (the package needs Pillow<10 and can
                        never share the app's Pillow-12 venv)
  (face_scoring/masks/watermark_inpaint all follow the same shape: ML interpreter resolved
   per capability, requirements-ml.txt pinned as a -c constraint, probe cache invalidated
   on success so the capability flips without a restart.)
  ollama_model       -> stream Ollama's /api/pull for the configured vision model
  klein_model        -> download the Klein 9B (KV) fp8 diffusion model into
                        <ComfyUI>/models/unet/klein/ — a PUBLIC download (no token). The KV
                        build caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising
                        step, so multi-reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs
                        up to 2.5x faster at identical quality. A 401 still logs recovery
                        steps as a safety net (see license_url below)
  klein_lora         -> download the consistency LoRA into <ComfyUI>/models/loras/klein/
  klein_text_encoder -> qwen_3_8b_fp8mixed into <ComfyUI>/models/text_encoders/
  klein_vae          -> flux2-vae into <ComfyUI>/models/vae/
  krea_model         -> the Krea 2 Turbo base into <ComfyUI>/models/diffusion_models/krea/
  krea_text_encoder  -> qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled into <ComfyUI>/models/text_encoders/
  krea_vae           -> qwen_image_vae into <ComfyUI>/models/vae/
  krea_identity_lora -> the Krea 2 Identity Edit LoRA (Civitai) into
                        <ComfyUI>/models/loras/krea/
  krea_nodes         -> git clone (ZIP fallback) the comfyui-krea2edit custom-node pack
                        into <ComfyUI>/custom_nodes/ — the ONLY action that installs code
                        rather than weights, and the only one whose success still requires
                        the user to restart ComfyUI (nodes register at startup only)

No shell, no client-supplied arguments: each action's command/URL/destination is fixed.

Pip actions are SERIALIZED (one at a time, second request queued in click order): two
pip processes writing the same environment race on a shared package's dist-info and
corrupt it — proven by repro (two concurrent installs of one big binary package into
one venv fail 6/6 with WinError 2 / Errno 13). Each pip run also retries once on a
transient file-lock error (an antivirus holding a fresh file). Model downloads and the
ollama pull don't touch a venv, so they stay parallel.

# Fixed catalog of the Klein downloads (re-checked 2026-07-17): all four files are
# PUBLIC downloads. The default UNET is the KV-cache build (flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8):
# it caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising step, so multi-
# reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs up to 2.5x faster at
# identical quality — same VAE/text-encoder. Unlike the plain 9b-fp8 repo (which is
# license-gated → 401 without a token), the KV repo is NOT access-gated: HF serves it
# publicly (verified: API gated=false, resolve → public CDN). The FLUX Non-Commercial
# License still governs USE. `license_url` is kept so a future re-gating (or a stale
# token) still degrades into actionable recovery steps rather than a bare 401.
# `legacy_names` = earlier default filenames still accepted as "already installed",
# so an install that fetched the pre-KV model never re-downloads ~10 GB (both variants
# resolve by name at generate time — see klein_edit_helper.resolve_klein_unet).

#                 monolithic `-r` install.
#   masks         rembg (u2net background removal) + onnxruntime (the runtime it
#                 RUNS on), + the same shared numpy / headless-opencv floor.
#                 onnxruntime is listed EXPLICITLY, not via a `rembg[cpu]` extra:
#                 rembg ≥2.0.50 imports onnxruntime at module load but stopped
#                 declaring it, so a scoped masks install resolved every package
#                 it knew about, reported success, and left `import rembg` dying
#                 on ModuleNotFoundError — the capability stayed ✗ with no reason
#                 shown (issue #24, 1Tomber). The explicit name is the durable
#                 choice: the `[cpu]`/`[gpu]` extras did not exist before 2.0.50
#                 and would silently resolve to nothing on an older pin, while
#                 the plain name is pinned once in requirements-ml.txt like every
#                 other ML package. _drop_provided_onnxruntime() below keeps it
#                 from stepping on a GPU build the user already has.
#   watermark_inpaint  simple-lama-inpainting (has its own dedicated worker below;
#                 listed here only so the anti-orphan test sees its package covered).
#   wd14          the 🏷️ WD14 tagger: onnxruntime (it IS an ONNX model) + numpy +
#                 headless opencv for decode/resize. NO new package — every one of
#                 the three is already pinned in requirements-ml.txt for
#                 face_scoring/masks, so a machine with either of those installed
#                 needs no pip work at all here (_drop_provided_onnxruntime also
#                 keeps this from stepping on a GPU onnxruntime build). Pillow is
#                 deliberately NOT used by the child: a dedicated ML env need not
#                 have it, and cv2.imdecode over bytes we read ourselves is also
#                 the unicode-path-safe way in (cv2.imread cannot open one on
#                 Windows). The ~400 MB of WEIGHTS are not a pip concern — the
