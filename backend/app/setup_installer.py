"""Setup installer: run whitelisted, self-contained installs in a background
thread and expose their live state for polling. Actions:

  ml_extras          -> pip install -r backend/requirements-ml.txt (the app's own venv):
                        installs ALL the ML extras at once — kept for a first-time setup
  face_scoring       -> pip install JUST the face-scoring packages (insightface + onnx-
                        runtime, versions read from requirements-ml.txt) into the inter-
                        preter probe_face_scoring resolves — install/repair ONE feature
  masks              -> pip install JUST the person-mask package (rembg) into the inter-
                        preter probe_masks resolves — install/repair ONE feature
  watermark_inpaint  -> install the watermark-inpainting package (simple-lama-inpainting,
                        version floor read from requirements-ml.txt) into a dedicated
                        3.10-3.12 interpreter. When the user has configured one it is used;
                        otherwise the action AUTO-PROVISIONS one — finds a base Python
                        3.10-3.12, builds an isolated venv under the data dir, installs CPU
                        torch + simple-lama into it, and records it as watermark.python. No
                        manual venv, no setting to edit (the package needs Pillow<10 and can
                        never share the app's Pillow-12 venv)
  (face_scoring/masks/watermark_inpaint all follow the same shape: ML interpreter resolved
   per capability, requirements-ml.txt pinned as a -c constraint, probe cache invalidated
   on success so the capability flips without a restart.)
  ollama_model       -> stream Ollama's /api/pull for the configured vision model
  klein_model        -> download the Klein 9B (KV) fp8 diffusion model into
                        <ComfyUI>/models/unet/klein/ — a PUBLIC download (no token). The KV
                        build caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising
                        step, so multi-reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs
                        up to 2.5x faster at identical quality. A 401 still logs recovery
                        steps as a safety net (see license_url below)
  klein_lora         -> download the consistency LoRA into <ComfyUI>/models/loras/klein/
  klein_text_encoder -> qwen_3_8b_fp8mixed into <ComfyUI>/models/text_encoders/
  klein_vae          -> flux2-vae into <ComfyUI>/models/vae/

No shell, no client-supplied arguments: each action's command/URL/destination is fixed.

Pip actions are SERIALIZED (one at a time, second request queued in click order): two
pip processes writing the same environment race on a shared package's dist-info and
corrupt it — proven by repro (two concurrent installs of one big binary package into
one venv fail 6/6 with WinError 2 / Errno 13). Each pip run also retries once on a
transient file-lock error (an antivirus holding a fresh file). Model downloads and the
ollama pull don't touch a venv, so they stay parallel.

# Fixed catalog of the Klein downloads (re-checked 2026-07-17): all four files are
# PUBLIC downloads. The default UNET is the KV-cache build (flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8):
# it caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising step, so multi-
# reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs up to 2.5x faster at
# identical quality — same VAE/text-encoder. Unlike the plain 9b-fp8 repo (which is
# license-gated → 401 without a token), the KV repo is NOT access-gated: HF serves it
# publicly (verified: API gated=false, resolve → public CDN). The FLUX Non-Commercial
# License still governs USE. `license_url` is kept so a future re-gating (or a stale
# token) still degrades into actionable recovery steps rather than a bare 401.
# `legacy_names` = earlier default filenames still accepted as "already installed",
# so an install that fetched the pre-KV model never re-downloads ~10 GB (both variants
# resolve by name at generate time — see klein_edit_helper.resolve_klein_unet).
