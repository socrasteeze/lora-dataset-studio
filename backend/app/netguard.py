"""Network access guard for non-loopback binds.

The app has NO user accounts (single local user by design): every route can read
API keys, launch GPU trainings or delete datasets. That is fine on 127.0.0.1 —
but `server.host` is configurable, and binding 0.0.0.0 (e.g. to reach the app
from a phone) would otherwise expose everything to the whole LAN.

Rule: requests from loopback clients are always allowed (the normal local flow,
untouched). A non-loopback (LAN) client is allowed straight through UNLESS the
user opted into a token via Settings (`server.require_token`) — a home LAN is
trusted by default, so no token has to be typed on a phone. When require_token
is on, the LAN client must present the access token — `run.py` generates one
automatically (and prints it) when none is set, so the gate can't be forgotten.
Token sources, in order:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - `X-LDS-Token: <token>` header
  - `?token=<token>` query parameter (first hit from a phone browser) — on
    success the flag is remembered in the signed session cookie so the SPA's
    subsequent fetches just work.

Escape hatch for setups with their own network isolation (VPN, reverse proxy
with auth, trusted Docker network): `LDS_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1`.
