"""Network access guard for non-loopback binds.

The app has NO user accounts (single local user by design): every route can read
API keys, launch GPU trainings or delete datasets. That is fine on 127.0.0.1 —
but `server.host` is configurable, and binding 0.0.0.0 (e.g. to reach the app
from a phone) would otherwise expose everything to the whole LAN.

Rule: requests from loopback clients are always allowed (the normal local flow,
untouched, and the path the container healthcheck uses). A non-loopback (LAN)
client is allowed straight through UNLESS the user opted into a token via
Settings (`server.require_token`) — a home LAN is trusted by default, so no token
has to be typed on a phone.

That default is wrong exactly once: when the bind is reachable from the public
internet (a RunPod pod's proxy URL, a tunnel). `LDS_PUBLIC=1` says so, and forces
the gate on regardless of `server.require_token`, so turning the setting off
cannot open the app to everyone. `run.py` generates a token automatically (and
prints it) when none is set, so the gate can't be forgotten.
Token sources, in order:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - `X-LDS-Token: <token>` header
  - `?token=<token>` query parameter (first hit from a phone browser) — on
    success the flag is remembered in the signed session cookie so the SPA's
    subsequent fetches just work.

Escape hatch for setups with their own network isolation (VPN, reverse proxy
with auth, trusted Docker network): `LDS_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1`.
