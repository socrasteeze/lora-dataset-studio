"""In-memory per-dataset batch-activity registry.

Long batch operations on a dataset — watermark detect/clean, caption/re-caption,
face analysis, framing classification — run server-side inside a request thread.
The UI's "in progress" indicator used to be React-local state, so reloading the
page lost it while the server kept working. This registry lets the dataset payload
advertise a live ``activity`` object the front-end can RESTORE on reload and poll
to completion.

Design notes
------------
* **In-memory ONLY (no DB).** A batch dies with the process; on restart the
  registry is empty, so the (now-dead) indicator correctly disappears — nothing to
  clean up, no phantom "in progress" persisted anywhere.
* **Thread-safe.** A single module lock guards the store; these batches run in
  request threads and two datasets can be worked in parallel.
* **Crash-proof.** ``begin``/``end`` are meant to be used with ``try/finally`` so a
  batch that raises never leaves a phantom entry. As a belt-and-braces safety net a
  per-entry TTL is purged on every read: even if ``end`` were somehow skipped, the
  indicator can never outlive ``_TTL_SECONDS``.
* **One indicator per dataset.** The GPU-exclusive vision window serializes GPU
  passes (including watermark cleaning when CUDA is selected); CPU passes are
  guarded client-side by the hook's single-flight ``wrap`` on this
  single-local-user app — so overlapping
  kinds don't happen in normal use. Should two ever overlap (e.g. two browser
  tabs firing a GPU and a CPU pass at once), ``get`` returns the most recently
  STARTED one; the UI restores a single indicator, which is acceptable.
