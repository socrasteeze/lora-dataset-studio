"""On-demand scan of ComfyUI's model folders for the "which file?" pickers.

The Klein model-file slots and Krea 2 Edit's base model / identity LoRA were
free-text fields: you typed a filename from memory and found out at generate
time whether it existed. This backs a picker of the files ACTUALLY on disk.

ONE MECHANISM, NOT A SECOND ONE
-------------------------------
Everything here goes through ``comfy_model_paths`` — the module that already
mirrors ComfyUI's ``folder_paths``/``extra_model_paths.yaml`` semantics, and that
the RESOLVERS use. A picker built on its own directory walk would list files the
resolver cannot load (and hide files it can) the day an install has an
``extra_model_paths.yaml``; that divergence is exactly what
``test_model_scanners_agree`` exists to prevent.

For the Krea base model the list is NOT ``list_models('diffusion_models')``: the
resolver only ever elects among ``krea_edit_helper._krea_unet_folders()`` (krea-
named subfolders + search-root level, minus the checkpoints the identity LoRA
renders as noise on). So the picker asks the RESOLVER for its candidates. Offering
a file the resolver would refuse is offering a choice that silently does nothing.

Slots are named, not free-form: the folder type arrives from an HTTP query
parameter, and ``list_models`` takes it straight to the filesystem.

Cache: per slot, keyed on a cheap change-signature of that slot's search roots
(each root's mtime) — mirrors ``klein_lora_picker``. Never scanned at boot, only
when the endpoint is hit, so an install with a slow/remote model mount pays only
when a panel that shows a picker is opened. ``force=True`` (the ↻ button)
bypasses the cache and catches a file added deep inside a subfolder, which a
root-level mtime cannot see.

Degradation is total: no ComfyUI configured / unreadable roots / a scan that
raises all produce an empty list, and the caller keeps a free-text field.
