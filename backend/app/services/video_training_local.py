"""Starting a video training on THIS machine, through ai-toolkit's own CLI.

Upstream writes this as the local sibling of a `cloud_video_training` module;
this fork trains video LOCALLY only (Divergence 4), so that one is not carried
and this is the whole video training lane. It exists for the reason both did:
`lora_training.launch_training` is a `FaceDataset` function from end to end. It exports images, checks captions, resolves a trigger word,
names the run from a base-model tag and freezes an image manifest in the
provenance registry. A `video_dataset` row has none of those columns, and its
folder is ALREADY the flat `clip_0001.mp4` + homonym `clip_0001.txt` shape
ai-toolkit reads — there is nothing to export. Threading a second entity through
that function would put a `getattr(ds, ..., None)` at each of those steps, which
is not a branch but a config assembled from defaults nobody can see.

WHAT IS SHARED, DELIBERATELY
----------------------------
Everything that must have exactly one implementation:

  * the ai-toolkit paths and the interpreter readiness probe;
  * the GPU admission sequence — vision window, ComfyUI work, the Ollama fence —
    taken in the SAME lock order (launch transaction -> queue ownership -> GPU
    arbiter), because a second, weaker guard here would simply be the one that
    loses the race;
  * the durable ownership fence (`training_in_progress` and friends), so an image
    training in flight blocks a video launch and vice versa;
  * the crash watcher and the log parser: ai-toolkit writes the same lines
    whatever it trains.

THE FENCE IS ONE INTEGER, AND TWO TABLES LIVE IN IT
---------------------------------------------------
`training_dataset_id` has always meant a `face_dataset.id`. Face dataset #3 and
video dataset #3 both exist and both resolve, so this lane stamps
`training_dataset_table` beside it and every reader of the fence asks. Without
that stamp `training_status` names a face dataset for a video run — on the wrong
page, with a Stop button that works.

WHY WEIGHTS ARE ANNOUNCED AND NOT FETCHED
-----------------------------------------
MiniMax H3 loads ~43 GB from `Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3`. ai-toolkit downloads what is
missing, silently, as part of "starting". A button that does that is not a
training button: it is a multi-hour download with a progress bar that says
`Starting up...`, and on a disk that cannot hold it, a crash an hour in. So the
size is named first and the download is a separate, explicit yes.
