"""SeedVR2 — the FIDELITY upscaler, next to Klein's rewriting "improve".

WHY IT EXISTS (issue #32, requested by SurpassHR)
-------------------------------------------------
The app already had one way to make a dataset image bigger and cleaner: the
Klein ✨ Upscale & improve pass. It is a diffusion EDIT — it re-renders skin,
hair and micro-detail from a prompt, so it genuinely improves a soft photo and
genuinely CHANGES it. On a dataset built to teach a likeness that is sometimes
the wrong trade: the crop you picked for its exact skin tone comes back with a
different one.

SeedVR2 is the other half of that choice. It is ByteDance-Seed's one-step
diffusion restoration model: it resolves detail at a higher resolution and
leaves the content where it was. Neither pass replaces the other, and the UI
says which is which in one line rather than leaving people to discover it on a
ruined batch.

THE ECOSYSTEM (measured 2026-08-02, not quoted from a README)
--------------------------------------------------------------
  * Node pack: `ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler` (numz / adrientoupet),
    Apache-2.0. Node ids are `SeedVR2LoadDiTModel`, `SeedVR2LoadVAEModel` and
    `SeedVR2VideoUpscaler` — read from the pack's own `define_schema`, NOT from
    its README, whose prose names differ (`SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler`) and would
    have made every preflight report a missing node on a correct install.
  * Weights: `numz/SeedVR2_comfyUI` on Hugging Face — anonymous HTTP 200, API
    `gated=false`, Apache-2.0, same licence as ByteDance's originals
    (`ByteDance-Seed/SeedVR2-3B` / `-7B`). Sizes measured from content-length:
    3B fp8 3.39 GB, 3B fp16 6.78 GB, 7B fp8 8.24 GB, 7B fp16 16.48 GB, VAE
    501 MB — all in that one repo. GGUF quantisations live in
    `AInVFX/SeedVR2_comfyUI`.
  * Licence check is the point of that paragraph: the repo is MIT and has
    refused an AGPL dependency before (ultralytics, for watermark detection).
    Apache-2.0 on BOTH the code and the weights is clean.

WHY THE NODE PACK IS NOT AUTO-INSTALLED (unlike comfyui-krea2edit)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Krea pack declares `dependencies = []`, so installing it is a clone and the
app does it. This one declares thirteen — diffusers, peft, omegaconf, einops,
rotary_embedding_torch, gguf, opencv-python… — and they belong in ComfyUI's
interpreter, which this app does not own and must never pip into. A clone alone
would land a pack that fails to import, and the user would read "install the
pack" about a pack that is already there. So the pack is DETECTED and explained
(install it through ComfyUI-Manager, restart ComfyUI), and only the WEIGHTS —
which are just files in a folder — are one-click downloadable from Setup.

WHY WE ONLY EVER SUBMIT A MODEL THAT IS ALREADY ON DISK
--------------------------------------------------------
Both loader nodes are "(Down)Load" nodes: their `model` combo lists every known
build and the node downloads it on first use. Handing them a name we have not
verified would start a multi-gigabyte download inside ComfyUI, from a button
that promised an upscale — exactly the "nothing downloads without a click" rule
this app keeps everywhere else. So the resolvers below list what is ON DISK and
`preflight()` refuses when nothing is.

ONE IMAGE PER JOB — and why there is no batch-size setting
------------------------------------------------------------
The node's `batch_size` is a VIDEO window: the frames in one batch share
temporal attention, which is what keeps a clip coherent. Feeding it five
unrelated dataset photos would let them bleed into each other. The requested
"batch size" therefore has no honest meaning for a photo set, and shipping the
knob anyway would ship a way to corrupt a batch. Images go one per job
(`batch_size=1`, which is also the node's required 4n+1 shape), the dataset
batch gets its throughput from the existing MAX_FANOUT queue, and the Settings
card says so instead of leaving a dead dial.

# --- The HIGH-RESOLUTION lane (tiling) --------------------------------------
# Idea, workflow and the measurement behind it: SurpassHR (GitHub #32), who hit
# a real CUDA OOM upscaling full-frame on an 11.6 GB card and shipped a tiled
# graph on his fork that reaches >4K on the same machine.
#
# WHAT WE PORTED, AND WHAT WE DID NOT. His graph chains three node packs: TTP
# (MIT) for the tiling itself, ComfyUI_essentials (MIT) and ComfyUI-Easy-Use
# (GPL-3.0) for what is, in the end, arithmetic — normalising a pixel count,
# dividing by 1024 to count tiles, resizing at the end. This repo is MIT and has
# refused a dependency over its licence before, and none of that arithmetic
# needs to happen inside a graph: it happens here, in Python, where it is also
# testable without a ComfyUI. So the lane depends on TTP alone, two classes.
#
# Node names read from the pack's CODE (TTP_toolsets.py NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS),
# never its README — in this very pack `TTP_Tile_image_size` maps to a class
# named `Tile_imageSize`, so the two do not even match.

# Tiles are square and this is their side. 1024 is what SurpassHR's graph uses
# and what the SeedVR2 VAE's own tiled encode/decode is sized for. It is the
# DEFAULT of `seedvr2.tile_px`, not a constant any more: the side is the single
# biggest VRAM lever on the tiled lane, and 1024 was chosen on a card that is
# not everyone's (see `tile_size`).
TILE_PX = 1024
# Bounds for that setting. Below 512 a tile carries too little context for the
# model to restore anything convincingly and the seam count explodes; above 2048

# How many megapixels the FULL-FRAME lane can hold, per GB of VRAM on the card.
# Deliberately conservative and deliberately a single number: this exists to say
# "past here you want tiles" BEFORE a run dies, not to predict VRAM use, which
# moves with the build, the batch and block swapping. Calibrated on the report
# that opened this: full-frame OOM at ~4K (8.3 MP) on 11.6 GB.
#
# KNOWN TO BE FALSELY PESSIMISTIC, and left that way ON PURPOSE. That OOM was
# measured BEFORE this lane gained the two memory savings taken from the same
# contribution — the DiT offloading to system RAM between phases and the tiled
# VAE encode/decode, both of which now apply to the full-frame lane too. The
# real headroom is therefore higher than 0.55 MP/GB implies, and this number
# will warn about frames that would in fact have fitted. Raising it would need a
# measurement nobody has taken; inventing a better-looking constant would trade
# a documented, harmless pessimism for an undocumented, harmful optimism. The
# failure mode of being too cautious is an unnecessary suggestion to install a
# node pack; the failure mode of being too bold is the CUDA out-of-memory this
# exists to prevent. Measure before you touch it.

# under it fits essentially anywhere, and tiling it would spend seam-blending on
# a picture that never needed it.
TILE_WORTH_IT_MP = 6.0
# Above this OUTPUT SHORT EDGE, 'always' tiles. The mechanism decides the shape
# of this rule: SeedVR2's `resolution` is the size the model actually works at,
# so tiling helps exactly when full-frame would push it well past the tile size
# it is comfortable with. At a 1080 target the model runs at 1080 either way —
# tiling would buy nothing and still pay for seams and a second pass; at 2160 it
# runs at 2160 full-frame versus 1024 per tile, which is the gap SurpassHR's
# side-by-side shows (GitHub #32).
# The 1.5x factor itself is a JUDGEMENT, not a measurement: it is placed so the
# shipped 1080 default keeps its single fast pass while 4K work tiles. If anyone
# measures the crossover properly, this is the number to move.
#
# It is a FACTOR of the tile side rather than a bare pixel count because the two
# move together: the crossover exists where full-frame starts working well past
# the size a tile is upscaled at, so halving the tile side must halve the
# crossover too. `seedvr2.tile_threshold` overrides it with a literal number for
# whoever wants to place the crossover by hand (see `tile_threshold`).

    graph chains three node packs: TTP for the tiling, plus ComfyUI_essentials
    (MIT) and ComfyUI-Easy-Use (GPL-3.0) for arithmetic — normalising a pixel
    count, dividing by 1024 to count tiles, resizing at the end. This repo is MIT
    and has refused a dependency over its licence before, and that arithmetic
    does not need to run inside a graph, so `tile_plan` does it in Python and
    hands the result in as `plan`. Net effect: one node pack instead of three,
    MIT instead of GPL-3.0, two classes to probe instead of six, and geometry
    that a test can check without a ComfyUI at all.

    The upscaler runs on the tile BATCH: `TTP_Image_Tile_Batch` emits every tile
    as one image batch, so a single SeedVR2 pass covers them all and never holds
    more than one tile's worth of activations. `batch_size` stays 1 for the same
    reason it does full-frame — it is a temporal window, and tiles of one still
    image are not frames of a video.

    `resolution` is the SHORT EDGE OF A TILE, not of the picture: each tile is

    # capacity across four times the surface, while a tile is upscaled in the
    # range the model is good at. Tiling therefore preserves HIGH-FREQUENCY
