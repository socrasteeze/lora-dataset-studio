"""In-memory background-job runner for the 🗃️ image bank.

Unlike dataset batches (dataset_activity), a bank pass runs over THOUSANDS of
files — holding the HTTP request open for its whole duration is not an option.
Each bank therefore gets at most ONE live background thread (scan / faces /
promote); the POST that starts it returns immediately and the UI polls the
bank payload, which embeds the job snapshot from here.

Same design contract as dataset_activity:
* **In-memory ONLY** — a job dies with the process; on restart the registry is
  empty and nothing phantom survives (raw scores already committed stay, so a
  re-run only pays for what's missing).
* **Thread-safe** — one module lock guards the store.
* **TTL-purged** — a finished snapshot is kept ~5 min so the UI can show the
  outcome, then purged on read; a running entry not touched for an hour is
  presumed dead and purged too (its thread would have to be truly stuck).
