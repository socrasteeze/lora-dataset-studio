"""Turning a built video dataset into an ai-toolkit job config — and reading back
what a two-expert model writes when it saves.

This is the video sibling of `lora_training._build_job_config_*`, kept in its own
module because it shares none of their inputs. Those builders read a `FaceDataset`
and its `train_settings` column; there is no such column on `video_dataset`, and
routing a video run through helpers that all `getattr(ds, ..., None)` would mean a
config assembled entirely from defaults that nobody could see. The entities are
different, so the builder is separate.

Like `video_targets`, this module is pure: a catalogue lookup, some arithmetic and
string work. No ffmpeg, no PyAV, no torch, no database. A cloud launcher can build
a config from a snapshot on a machine that has no trainer installed at all.

WHERE THE VALUES COME FROM
--------------------------
An end-to-end smoke run has been through this path: a dataset built by the video
Bank, handed to the local ai-toolkit, trained to decreasing loss (0.28 -> 0.23) at
81 frames and 384 px. The non-obvious settings below are that run's, and the two
shipped ai-toolkit example configs it derives from. Where no such source exists —
a base repository for LTX or MiniMax — this module RAISES rather than invents one.
A guessed repo id does not fail at build time; it fails after the GPU is rented.

WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED
-----------------------
That run filled 24 GB and took 170-185 s per step. `low_vram` is why: it keeps one
expert on the CPU and shuttles it over PCIe every boundary switch. It is the
default here because a 24 GB card cannot do without it, and it is a PARAMETER
because the whole reason to move a video run to a rented 80 GB pod is to turn it
off.
