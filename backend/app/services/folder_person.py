""""Single person here" — folder-level person assertions for the 🗃️ image bank.

WHY
---
"Group by person" is the bank's most expensive pass: one InsightFace embedding
per image, thousands of images, minutes of GPU (or a long CPU crawl). On scraped
material that cost usually buys nothing — the sources are already ONE FOLDER PER
PERSON, and the pass spends its time rediscovering by inference what the folder
name said for free.

This module is the user saying it instead. One click on a subfolder:
  * every image of that folder gets a person id IMMEDIATELY — zero inference;
  * the embeddings pass then SKIPS those images entirely (that skip IS the
    saving, not a nicety on top of it);
  * the rule is PERSISTED, so a re-scan keeps it and an image that lands in the
    folder tomorrow joins the group on insert;
  * it is REVOCABLE — the user was wrong, one click puts the folder back in the
    way of normal clustering and dissolves the asserted group.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not verify anything. A declaration is not evidence, so a SAMPLE CHECK is
offered next to it: ~15 images spread across the folder, embedded on their own,
compared at the SAME cosine threshold the clustering uses (bank.face_threshold —
there is one truth about "same person" in this app, not two). Its verdict is
INFORMATIVE: "sample consistent (14/15 same person)" or "2 different faces in
the sample — check this folder". The assertion stands either way; the user's
folder, the user's call.

HOW IT COEXISTS WITH THE EMBEDDING CLUSTERS
-------------------------------------------
Same table, same column, same id space: `bank_image.face_cluster`. An asserted
group IS a person cluster — every reader (the person chips, the coverage advice,
the cluster filter, promote) keeps working with no knowledge of this module.
What tells them apart is `bank_image.face_cluster_origin` ('asserted' vs NULL),
and it exists for exactly two reasons:
  1. the embeddings pass must not silently overwrite the user's word, and must
     not renumber its own clusters onto an asserted id — so it skips asserted
     rows and OFFSETS its ids above every asserted id in the bank;
  2. revoking must know which ids it may clear.
Because the ids share one space, a later CROSS-FOLDER MERGE (linking two folders
that turn out to be the same person, or joining an asserted folder to a computed
cluster) is a plain id remap over `face_cluster` — nothing here forbids it, and
an asserted folder is not a wall around its images.

MAX_SCAN_FOLDERS = 20
# Ceiling for the PREFLIGHT — the same probe, run as the PREAMBLE of 👤 Group by
# person instead of hiding behind a button nobody presses. It is generous where
# the manual scan is cautious, because the comparison is the opposite one: the
# user is about to pay one embedding per image over the whole bank, so fifteen
# per folder is a rounding error next to it (200 folders = 3 000 embeddings,
# against 200 × 300 = 60 000 for the pass they just asked for). It stays a
# ceiling and not "no limit" — a bank of ten thousand folders would turn a
# preamble into a pass of its own — and whatever it does not reach is stated out
# loud, never assumed away.
MAX_PREFLIGHT_FOLDERS = 200

# --- the re-draw budget -----------------------------------------------------
# THE HOLE THIS FILLS. The sample was a single draw: fifteen images, whatever
# came back. On scraped folders full of crops, backs and blur that draw can land
# on fifteen images with no readable face, and the folder ends with NO verdict —
# fifteen embeddings spent for nothing, and then the full pass over its three
# thousand images anyway. Exactly the cost the preflight exists to avoid, paid
# twice. Measured on a real bank: four folders of six, 3 546 / 1 866 / 488 / 466
# images, each reported "only 0 of 15 sampled images had a usable face".
#
# So a draw that cannot be read is REPLACED, not accepted. The target is still
# fifteen images with a usable face; what changes is that the probe keeps drawing
# (new images, never one it has already tried, still spread across the folder)
# until it reaches that target or runs out of budget.
#
# THE BUDGET IS THE POINT. Without a ceiling "keep drawing" IS the full pass,
# reached through the back door. Three numbers bound it, and the smallest wins:
PROBE_TARGET_FACES = SAMPLE_SIZE
# 1. a hard ceiling of draws per folder. 60 is not a round number: reaching 15
#    usable faces needs 15/p draws at a hit rate p, and 60 is exactly the budget
#    for p = 1/4 — one readable face in four images. Below that the folder is
#    genuinely face-poor, and MORE draws would not change the answer, only its
#    price; the verdict says so instead.
PROBE_MAX_DRAWS = 4 * SAMPLE_SIZE
# 2. never more than a quarter of the folder. This is what stops the probe from
#    becoming the pass on SMALL folders: sampling 60 of an 80-image folder would
#    cost most of what analysing it costs, for a suggestion. In practice this cap
#    binds below ~240 images and the ceiling above it, so folders of 60 or fewer
#    keep the exact single draw they have today.
PROBE_MAX_FOLDER_SHARE = 0.25
# 3. at most this many child calls per scan. Each round is one subprocess and one
#    model load shared by EVERY folder still short of its target, so rounds are
#    cheap in aggregate — but they are not free, and an unbounded loop is not a
#    budget. Two rounds cover the realistic cases (see _topup_draws).
