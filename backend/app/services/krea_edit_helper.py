"""Krea 2 Identity Edit — the SECOND local generation engine, next to Klein.

WHAT IT IS
----------
Krea 2 Identity Edit is an identity-preserving edit LoRA for the Krea 2 base
model, driven by the `comfyui-krea2edit` custom-node pack. Given ONE reference
photo it re-stages the subject (angle, framing, light, background) while keeping
the face, the body morphology and the permanent markings — WITHOUT any character
LoRA. That is exactly the bootstrap case the dataset builder needs: a character
who has no LoRA yet.

WHY A HAND-BUILT GRAPH (no shipped workflow JSON)
-------------------------------------------------
Klein loads `workflows/improve skin.json`, a file lifted from a developer's own
ComfyUI whose loader nodes hardcode filenames that exist on no fresh install —
`klein_edit_helper` then has to re-resolve every one of them. Building the Krea
graph in code removes that whole class of bug: every loader value comes from a
resolver, so there is nothing to drift.

THE GRAPH (validated against /object_info on a live install)
-----------------------------------------------------------
    UNETLoader -> LoraLoaderModelOnly(identity edit LoRA) -> Krea2EditModelPatch -> KSampler
    LoadImage  -> VAEEncode -> source_latent  ^                positive: Krea2EditGroundedEncode(prompt, image)
                                                              negative: Krea2EditGroundedEncode('',     image)
    CLIPLoader(qwen3-vl 4B, type='krea2') · VAELoader(qwen image vae) · EmptySD3LatentImage

BOTH custom nodes are mandatory:
  * `Krea2EditGroundedEncode` is what makes the text encoder actually SEE the
    reference. With a plain `CLIPTextEncode` the reference has no effect at all
    (measured — not a quality nuance, the identity simply does not transfer).
    The NEGATIVE branch is grounded too, exactly like the pack's own reference
    workflow.
  * `Krea2EditModelPatch` injects the source latent (+ the anti-blur pixel path)
    into the model.

MEASURED CONSTRAINTS (2026-07-25, live install — do not "simplify" these away)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * cfg 1.0, 10 steps, euler/simple, edit LoRA at 1.0 — the pack's own numbers.
  * The output format must MATCH the source's aspect ratio and stay <= 2 MP: the
    LoRA was trained on same-size pairs and preservation degrades otherwise.
  * `BigLoveKreaEdit1_fp8mixed` renders PURE NOISE with this LoRA (it is not a
    Krea 2 Raw/Turbo checkpoint). It is excluded from base-model resolution.

EVERY PIECE IS NOW AUTO-INSTALLED (setup_installer: `krea_model`,
`krea_text_encoder`, `krea_vae`, `krea_identity_lora` and `krea_nodes` — the
first custom-node pack this app clones). Selecting the engine and pressing
Generate fires them, exactly like Klein; Setup ▸ Install has the same button.
This module keeps only the JUDGEMENT (what is missing, what is present but not
loadable, which node classes are absent) — the fetching lives in setup_installer.
The state of the world behind that decision, RE-MEASURED 2026-07-27 (read this
before re-quoting it — the previous version of this paragraph was a photograph of
one moment that became an architecture decision for weeks):

  * The original claim — "weights we have no verified direct URL for" — is
    OBSOLETE. All three Hugging Face pieces live in ONE public, NON-GATED repo,
    `Comfy-Org/Krea-2`, under the exact canonical filenames the resolvers below
    look for: `diffusion_models/krea2_turbo_fp8_scaled.safetensors` (13.1 GB),
    `text_encoders/qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled.safetensors` (5.2 GB) and
    `vae/qwen_image_vae.safetensors` (254 MB). Measured: anonymous HTTP 200 on
    each, no token, `gated=false`.
  * The identity LoRA (Civitai 2761113) also downloaded anonymously on that date
    — 307 to a signed CDN URL, then real safetensors bytes, no API key.
  * The node pack declares `dependencies = []`, so installing it is a clone, not
    a pip run.

None of it sits behind a licence checkbox a human has to tick in a browser. That
said, an OPEN download today is not a guarantee: the installer sends a Civitai
key when the user has one, tries without when they do not, and turns a 401/403
into instructions — because Civitai gates part of its catalogue with rules that
have changed before and vary by country.

The preflight still publishes the full `_studio_missing_response` shape (every
gap, its expected path inside the user's ComfyUI, the page it comes from): a
machine that cannot download — offline, proxied, no valid ComfyUI folder — must
still get a complete answer. Never a silent failure, never an inert button.

If you are about to conclude "Krea can't be auto-installed", re-run the
measurement first — that sentence has already been wrong once, for weeks.
