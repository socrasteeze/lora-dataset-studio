"""Krea 2 Identity Edit — the SECOND local generation engine, next to Klein.

WHAT IT IS
----------
Krea 2 Identity Edit is an identity-preserving edit LoRA for the Krea 2 base
model, driven by the `comfyui-krea2edit` custom-node pack. Given ONE reference
photo it re-stages the subject (angle, framing, light, background) while keeping
the face, the body morphology and the permanent markings — WITHOUT any character
LoRA. That is exactly the bootstrap case the dataset builder needs: a character
who has no LoRA yet.

WHY A HAND-BUILT GRAPH (no shipped workflow JSON)
-------------------------------------------------
Klein loads `workflows/improve skin.json`, a file lifted from a developer's own
ComfyUI whose loader nodes hardcode filenames that exist on no fresh install —
`klein_edit_helper` then has to re-resolve every one of them. Building the Krea
graph in code removes that whole class of bug: every loader value comes from a
resolver, so there is nothing to drift.

THE GRAPH (validated against /object_info on a live install)
-----------------------------------------------------------
    UNETLoader -> LoraLoaderModelOnly(identity edit LoRA) -> Krea2EditModelPatch -> KSampler
    LoadImage  -> VAEEncode -> source_latent  ^                positive: Krea2EditGroundedEncode(prompt, image)
                                                              negative: Krea2EditGroundedEncode('',     image)
    CLIPLoader(qwen3-vl 4B, type='krea2') · VAELoader(qwen image vae) · EmptySD3LatentImage

An OPTIONAL second reference joins the patch as `source_image_b` and both
encodes as `image_b` — the pack's only `_b` slot, and it wants a DIFFERENT
subject (a person or a scene), never another angle of the same face. See
build_workflow for the two traps it carries (no second VAEEncode; ref_boost
changes hands).

BOTH custom nodes are mandatory:
  * `Krea2EditGroundedEncode` is what makes the text encoder actually SEE the
    reference. With a plain `CLIPTextEncode` the reference has no effect at all
    (measured — not a quality nuance, the identity simply does not transfer).
    The NEGATIVE branch is grounded too, exactly like the pack's own reference
    workflow.
  * `Krea2EditModelPatch` injects the source latent (+ the anti-blur pixel path)
    into the model.

MEASURED CONSTRAINTS (2026-07-25, live install — do not "simplify" these away)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * cfg 1.0, 8 steps, euler/simple, edit LoRA at 1.0 — the calibrated
    dataset-restaging profile.
  * Dataset variations can request their catalog card's aspect ratio and stay <=
    2 MP. The installed v1.2 node's ``fit`` geometry supports that target even
    when it differs from the source; free-prompt reference edits keep the source
    aspect by omitting a requested ratio.
  * `BigLoveKreaEdit1_fp8mixed` renders PURE NOISE with this LoRA (it is not a
    Krea 2 Raw/Turbo checkpoint). It is excluded from base-model resolution.

EVERY PIECE IS NOW AUTO-INSTALLED (setup_installer: `krea_model`,
`krea_text_encoder`, `krea_vae`, `krea_identity_lora` and `krea_nodes` — the
first custom-node pack this app clones). Selecting the engine and pressing
Generate fires them, exactly like Klein; Setup ▸ Install has the same button.
This module keeps only the JUDGEMENT (what is missing, what is present but not
loadable, which node classes are absent) — the fetching lives in setup_installer.
The state of the world behind that decision, RE-MEASURED 2026-07-27 (read this
before re-quoting it — the previous version of this paragraph was a photograph of
one moment that became an architecture decision for weeks):

  * The original claim — "weights we have no verified direct URL for" — is
    OBSOLETE. All three Hugging Face pieces live in ONE public, NON-GATED repo,
    `Comfy-Org/Krea-2`, under the exact canonical filenames the resolvers below
    look for: `diffusion_models/krea2_turbo_fp8_scaled.safetensors` (13.1 GB),
    `text_encoders/qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled.safetensors` (5.2 GB) and
    `vae/qwen_image_vae.safetensors` (254 MB). Measured: anonymous HTTP 200 on
    each, no token, `gated=false`.
  * The identity LoRA (Civitai 2761113) also downloaded anonymously on that date
    — 307 to a signed CDN URL, then real safetensors bytes, no API key.
  * The node pack declares `dependencies = []`, so installing it is a clone, not
    a pip run.

None of it sits behind a licence checkbox a human has to tick in a browser. That
said, an OPEN download today is not a guarantee: the installer sends a Civitai
key when the user has one, tries without when they do not, and turns a 401/403
into instructions — because Civitai gates part of its catalogue with rules that
have changed before and vary by country.

The preflight still publishes the full `_studio_missing_response` shape (every
gap, its expected path inside the user's ComfyUI, the page it comes from): a
machine that cannot download — offline, proxied, no valid ComfyUI folder — must
still get a complete answer. Never a silent failure, never an inert button.

If you are about to conclude "Krea can't be auto-installed", re-run the
measurement first — that sentence has already been wrong once, for weeks.

    This resolver used to log a warning and elect a base model on its own when

    how an entire training ran on a third-party finetune nobody chose: the

    symptom was images that were subtly not the model asked for — visible after
    the expensive part, not before it.

    A setting that quietly resolves to something OTHER than what it displays is
    the worst failure mode available to us. So a pin that cannot be resolved is a
    STOP, naming the file, and clearing the field is the explicit gesture that
    goes back to auto-detection.

    # --- Optional SECOND reference (the pack's `_b` slots) ---------------------
    # Wired EXACTLY like the pack's own two-reference workflow
    # (workflows/krea2_identity_edit.json): the extra image reaches the patch and
    # BOTH grounded encodes — the negative included, because that is the trained
    # unconditional.
    #
    # Two things here are counter-intuitive and were read off the node source, not
    # guessed. Do not "complete" either of them:
    #
    #  1. NO second VAEEncode. The pack also exposes `source_latent_b`, and its
    #     reference workflow connects it — but `Krea2EditModelPatch.patch` rebuilds
    #     `src` from the PIXEL path whenever `vae` + `source_image` are both
    #     connected, which this graph always does. `source_latent_b` is therefore
    #     read only when the pixel path is off; adding it here would encode an
    #     image on every render for a value the node never looks at.
    #
    #  2. `ref_boost_a` is raised to the SAME value as `ref_boost`. The node
    #     applies `ref_boost` to the LAST reference and `ref_boost_a` to the
    #     FIRST. With one reference the primary IS the last one, so it gets the
    #     configured krea.ref_boost. Adding a second reference silently demotes
    #     the primary to "first" — without this line the user's tuned value would
    #     jump onto the second reference and the primary would fall back to the
    #     hardcoded 1.0. Keeping both equal means adding an angle changes what the
    #     model sees, never how hard it pulls on the reference already there.

    anything is copied or queued), ValueError on a missing source, RuntimeError
    when ComfyUI isn't configured.

    `extra_ref_paths`: the SECOND subject, in order — one is used, because
    `Krea2EditModelPatch` and `Krea2EditGroundedEncode` each expose a single
    extra slot (`_b`) and no more. Anything beyond it is dropped here rather than
    silently at graph-build time. A path that no longer exists is skipped with a
    log line, never fatal: an edit must not die over an optional reference.

    WHAT belongs here, per the pack: a DIFFERENT subject — "scene first, subject
    second", "two distinct people ... subject B on the `_b` inputs". Another
    angle of the SAME person is off-label and comes back duplicated. That is why
    the caller feeds this from the edit DIALOG and never from the dataset's extra
    references, which are angles of one face by construction (see
    face_dataset_service.LOCAL_EDIT_REF_SUPPORT). Wiring it to the dataset pool
    was this feature's first shape, and it guaranteed the wrong photo.

    `generation_loras`: ordered [{file, strength}] rows of the run's always-on
    LoRA preset (already resolved from config by the caller — a request only ever
    names a preset). Rows whose file is absent, or whose strength is 0, are
