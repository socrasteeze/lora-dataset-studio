# --- Anime / drawn character --------------------------------------------------
# The one subject type whose lock INVERTS a rule every other type takes for
# granted. For a human, an animal or a product the rendering is a constant we can
# safely hardcode ("realistic photograph") and the identity lives in physical
# traits — skin texture, coat markings, material finish. A drawn character has
# none of that: it is defined by its DESIGN (hair colour and shape, eye shape and
# iris colour, the signature outfit, the accessories, the marks) and by the ART
# STYLE it is drawn in. So this lock has to do two things no other lock does:
#   1. name design traits instead of physical ones, and
#   2. ACTIVELY FORBID the photorealism the other locks demand. Merely omitting
#      "realistic photograph" is not enough: the edit engines default to photo,
#      and the reference is the only thing holding the style — say it out loud.
# The signature OUTFIT is deliberately listed as identity, the exact opposite of
# the human path (which bakes OUTFIT_VARY into every shot so clothing does not
# bind to the person). For a character, the costume IS the character.

    FIRST, descriptive tags after — reads as "change nothing", so Klein returned
    a near-copy of the reference (live repro 2026-07-10: every variation looked
    like a plain upscale). Structure follows the fal.ai/BFL edit guidance:
      1. direct command first (the change),
      2. the FULL intended result (framing-specific detail — Klein under-fills

    restore them). All steering therefore lives in the POSITIVE prompt.
    `nsfw=True` drops the SFW clamp and allows explicit nudity with natural
    anatomy.
    `suffix` (dataset prompt-suffix) joins the DESCRIPTIVE portion (2. — appended
    to the creative prompt, before the framing detail): instruction-first means
    the description IS the command, so the suffix steers the intended result and

    byte-identical output.
    `label` (the variation label) picks this shot's concrete garment — see the

# --- Krea 2 Identity Edit wrapper --------------------------------------------
# MEASURED on a live install (2026-07-25), single reference photo, NO character
# LoRA:
#   identity holds by itself — forehead/neck tattoos, five piercings, hoop
#      earrings, body morphology, all carried from the one reference;
#   the requested FRAMING is honoured (a real full-length shot when asked),
#      which the API-engine wrapper never managed on this model — that wrapper
#      leads with preservation ("change nothing"), and Krea answered with a
#      close-up whatever the shot asked for. So Krea reuses the KLEIN wrapper's
#      shape: imperative command first, full intended result, then the identity
#      lock. Same model class (instruction edit + reference grounding), same
#      winning structure.
#   ⚠ the OUTFIT never changed, and the TATTOOS were REDRAWN each time (same
#      spirit, different design) — the two things this wrapper has to fix.
#
# Krea reuses the `klein_identity` editable lock deliberately: it is the "local
# edit engine" identity lock, already per-subject-type and already overridable in
# Settings. A second copy of the same sentence would be one more thing for the
# user to keep in sync, for no behavioural gain.

# The model PRESERVES anything it is not positively ordered to change, so a
# NEGATION is a no-op on it. These rules turn the catalog's negative outfit
# phrasings into a concrete positive garment (see krea_edit_helper.outfit_for:
# deterministic per shot label, so outfits vary across the dataset but a
# regenerate of one shot reproduces its own). Applied at WRAP time only — the
# stored `variation_prompt` keeps the raw catalog text, so the other engines are
# untouched and a regenerate re-applies the current rules exactly once.
#
# ALSO APPLIED TO KLEIN since 2026-07-27, on measurement, and to the two LOCAL
# edit engines ONLY. What Klein actually does with the negation (5 pairs, same
# seed, one factor changed):
#   • it is NOT copying the reference garment — the negation IS followed, and the
#     "colour leaks in tight shots" reading did NOT reproduce: the two fresh bust
#     shots came back beige and grey-green knits, muted neutrals, not the
#     reference's olive. That symptom is written off.
#   • what DOES collapse is the lower half: all three wide shots answered the
#     negation with blue jeans and pale sneakers, whatever the top. A dataset of
#     that teaches the LoRA "this person wears blue jeans".
#   • the concrete garment was obeyed exactly in 5/5 and broke the collapse in
#     3/3 (grey denim / black trousers / black trousers) with three visibly
#     different tops. That is the reason it ships here — not the colour claim.
# Scoped to the local engines this fork ships (Divergence 1): the measurement
# was made on Klein, and a Klein result is not evidence about a different model
# family.

# Permanent markings were redrawn on every render (measured). A dataset built
# from that teaches the LoRA an AVERAGE tattoo — the exact failure mode a
# character LoRA must not have.
#
# ⚠️ The first version of this hold order ENUMERATED what to preserve ("tattoos
# with the same design..., the same scars, moles and piercings"). It was assumed
# to "cost nothing when the subject has no markings". It cost a great deal: a
# text encoder does not bind "reproduce X as in the reference" — it reads the
# word `tattoos`, and paints tattoos. Reported within hours on subjects who have
# none. Naming a feature summons it; this is the oldest trap in prompting, and
# the enumeration walked straight into it.
#
# So the order now holds the SKIN, without naming a single feature. What is on
# the reference is carried by the reference conditioning, not by this sentence —
# whose only job is to forbid invention and redrawing.
#
# The re-worded order had only ever been checked in TEXT (the word was gone from
# the prompt). It was verified IN IMAGE on 2026-07-27, on Klein, before being
# extended to it — three shots on a subject with no markings at all, with and
# without the sentence, same seed: nothing invented in 3/3, the pairs are
# near-identical. And on the tattooed subject it earns its place: on the outdoor
# bust the forehead piece VANISHED without it and is fully there with it, same
# seed; the jaw work is preserved on both sides on the close-up; the wide shot is
# a draw. Hence: applied to Klein too, and to the local edit engines only.

# shot label via crc32 — NOT hash(), whose PYTHONHASHSEED randomisation would give
# the same shot a different outfit on every app restart. Three properties at once:
# outfits genuinely differ across the dataset, one shot regenerates identically,
# and no randomness ever leaks into a stored prompt.
#
# SIZE IS MEASURED, not decorative. With crc32 modulo N, the load histogram over
# the shipped catalog depends only on N, so the count was chosen by measuring it:
# at 12 garments, 41 eligible shots collapsed onto 11 distinct ones with the
# worst garment carrying 6 (a dataset that trades one uniform for another); at 25
# they spread over 23 distinct ones with the worst carrying 4. Neighbouring sizes
# are NOT monotonically better (24 peaks at 5, 22 at 6) — hence the pinned
# distribution test, which fails if a catalog change re-concentrates the picks.
# Every entry differs from the others on at least two of colour / cut / sleeve
# length / material, so two shots that DO share a garment still look apart, and
# all of them are neutral, everyday and plausible from a face crop to a full
# body. Nothing here may name a summonable skin feature (see _SUMMONABLE in the

# These are authored COMPLETE: the outfit/expression augmentation above is a
# HUMAN concern (an animal wears no outfit, an object has no expression), so it is
# NEVER run on them. Every label is GLOBALLY UNIQUE across all catalogs so the
# by-label resolvers (prompt_by_label / aspect_for_label / is_nsfw_label) keep
# working on the union with no subject_type threading — enforced by
# test_labels_globally_unique. The `framing` stays the internal enum
# (face/bust/body/back) so composition, aspect and the stored column are shared;
# only the LABEL/PROMPT wording adapts (the UI relabels the group headers per
# type). First honest drafts, to be refined. No NSFW catalog for these types.

# --- Anime catalog ------------------------------------------------------------
# Authored from the framing vocabulary of the MEDIUM, not of photography. Anime
# and its booru tagging have their own shot language — bust-up, cowboy shot
# (knee-up), full body, character-sheet turnaround, expression sheet — and those
# are the crops a drawn character is actually published in, so they are the crops
# a LoRA should see. Nothing here says "photo", "lens", "depth of field" or
# "studio lighting": the identity lock spends its whole budget forbidding
# photorealism and a catalog that whispered "close-up photo of" would undo it.
#
# Two deliberate departures from the human catalog:
#   • the SIGNATURE OUTFIT is named as identity in almost every shot, where the
#     human catalog bakes OUTFIT_VARY ("a different casual outfit") into every
#     shot that names none. A real person's clothes must NOT bind to them; a
#     character's costume is half of what makes them recognisable. Two shots do
#     offer an alternate outfit — as an explicit, opt-in card, not the default.
#   • the CHARACTER SHEET shots (front / side / back on a plain background) have
#     no photographic equivalent. They are how character designs are published
#     and they give the LoRA clean, unambiguous silhouette coverage.
# `_augment_prompt` is NEVER run here (same rule as every non-human catalog).

# the catalog, have an LLM write more, import the result. The shots live in the
# config (`custom_shots`), per subject type — NOT in localStorage: a catalog that
# vanishes when the browser is cleared, after paying an LLM to write it, is a
# feature that punishes its user, and the config is what makes the same shots
# visible from a second device and part of the full backup.
#
# The frontend validates on import (`shotImport.js`) and never sends the aspect
# (it is resolved server-side per label), so a custom shot is stored exactly as
# {id, label, prompt, framing, nsfw?}. This sanitizer is the second line: config
# .json is a plain file a user can hand-edit, and every shot that reaches it must
# still satisfy the invariants — enum framing, and above all a label that does
# NOT shadow a built-in one (see the by-label resolvers below).

# --- CONCEPT leak detection (kind=concept) ----------------------------------
# A concept LoRA teaches a recurring element (a pose, an act, an effect) that must bind
# to the TRIGGER word, never to caption words. A caption "leaks" when it NAMES that
# element. Unlike identity (a FIXED vocabulary: hair/skin/eyes), the concept vocabulary is
# PER-DATASET, so the lexicon is DERIVED from the dataset's own concept_desc — never a
# hard-coded list:
#   1. the meaningful words of concept_desc itself (singular/plural tolerated by the regex);
#   2. the cached LLM ban-list (ds.concept_terms), when present;
#   3. the basic lexical FIELD of any body region the description ANCHORS — and only then.
#      "leg behind head position" anchors the lower-limb family, so the periphrases a
#      captioner reaches for ("knees lifted", "feet raised", "thighs") are caught even
#      though the description never spells them out. A concept about "a mirror selfie"
#      anchors NO body family, so leg words are never added: the field is scoped to the
#      anchors actually present, not sprayed onto every concept.
# This is exactly why the leg_behind incident leaked: the ban-list was the 4 words of the
# description; "knees/feet/thighs/lifted/raised" were never listed, so the omission net
# had nothing to catch — and the aggregate badge FORCED 0 for concept datasets, hiding it.
