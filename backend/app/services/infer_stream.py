"""Run one of the `backend/infer/*.py` helper scripts in the dedicated ML
interpreter and READ ITS PROGRESS WHILE IT RUNS.

Extracted verbatim from face_similarity._run_scorer, which solved this first for
the face-scoring pass: `subprocess.run()` only hands the output back once the
child has exited, so every `[tag] i/N` line those scripts print all along was
unreadable until it no longer mattered — the bar sat at 0 for the whole pass and
then jumped to N/N, which reads exactly like a hang.

Both the scoring pass and the concept face-mask preview now share this one
mechanism instead of growing a second copy of it. Callers own their own line
grammar (one regex each); this module owns the plumbing:

* Popen, not run() — stdout is read here, stderr is drained by a thread (a full
  pipe would deadlock the child), both bounded: only the last few stderr lines
  are kept, for the error message.
* A watchdog kills the child on timeout and says so, rather than hanging forever.
* A callback that raises must never take the pass down with it: progress is a
  display concern, the work is the work.
* Optionally, a STOP that asks before it kills (see `should_stop`).

    ``env``/``cwd`` are for scripts whose weights live outside the default
    cache. Omitting them is not neutral: JoyCaption resolves its model through
    HF_HOME, so a run without it re-downloads ~8 GB onto a machine that already
    had the model — the same failure that made a peer re-fetch 352 MB when its
    models_root was dropped. None keeps the inherited environment, which is what
    every existing caller wants.

    Returns ``(stdout, stderr_lines, returncode, timed_out)``.

    STOPPING — ``should_stop()`` is polled while the child runs. On its first
    true, ``on_stop()`` is called ONCE (the caller's hook: these scripts are
    asked to wind up by a sentinel file, which the caller owns because it also
    owns the payload that named it) and the child is then given ``stop_grace``
    seconds to exit on its own before being killed.

    Asking before killing is the whole point. These children hold their results
    in memory until they print one final JSON line, so a kill discards
    everything computed so far — the exact waste a Stop button is supposed to
    avoid. The kill remains as a BACKSTOP for the case the child cannot answer:
    a stop asked while it is deep inside a model load or a several-hundred-
    megabyte download reaches no polling point, and there a kill costs nothing
    because nothing has been computed yet.
