"""Contention-driven `keep_alive` policy for the Ollama vision model.

The problem
-----------
Loading the vision model costs **12.8 s** on the reference machine; a warm
inference costs **0.52 s**. A cold call is therefore ~25x a warm one. Until now
`describe_image_ollama` defaulted to `keep_alive=0`, so every *isolated* call
(auto head-crop on a reference upload, a re-crop, a single watermark probe) paid
that 12.8 s in full — and a user cropping five references in a row paid it five
times.

The naive fix — "just keep it warm" — is worse than it looks. The vision model's
real footprint is **7.5 GB** (qwen3-vl 8b + an 8k KV cache), and a loaded ComfyUI
sits at ~19.1 GB of the 24.5 GB available. 19.1 + 7.5 = 26.6 > 24.5: they do not
both fit. Under WDDM, Windows does not raise an OOM on VRAM over-commitment — the
driver pages silently and `nvidia-smi` shows nothing. A measured vision pass with
ComfyUI resident ran at **6.99 s/img instead of 0.52 s/img (13.5x slower)**, with
Ollama itself reporting a 43%/57% CPU/GPU split. "No crash" is not "they
cohabit".

So holding 7.5 GB on speculation is only acceptable if we can **give it back on
demand**. That is what this module is: a *lease*, not a timer.

The design: revocation, not prediction
--------------------------------------
The tempting signal is "poll ComfyUI's `/queue` before deciding". It is the wrong
instrument, and this is the crux of the whole design:

  A poll answers "is somebody busy **right now**". The risk we are taking is
  "will somebody want the card **in the next 120 s**". A queue that is empty at
  decision time says nothing about the ComfyUI job the user fires ten seconds
  later — and by then the poll is long over. A point-in-time signal cannot cover
  the window it authorises.

The signals that *can* cover the window are the ones LDS controls, because LDS is
notified by construction rather than by asking:

  * `training_in_progress` — a system-state flag LDS itself writes.
  * `ImageGenerationQueue` — LDS's own ComfyUI job queue, a local table.

Both are plain database reads: no network, no timeout, nothing that can hang a
caption call. And both are *hookable*: `revoke()` below is called from the exact
code paths that take the GPU (`job_queue.process_one` right before submitting to
ComfyUI, `lora_training` right before spawning ai-toolkit), so a held lease is
handed back before the contender loads anything.

What this deliberately does NOT cover (stated honestly)
-------------------------------------------------------
Work submitted to ComfyUI by *something other than LDS* — ComfyUI's own web UI,
another app on the same machine. LDS gets no notification for that and, per the
argument above, polling would not help either. The exposure is bounded by
`warm_seconds()` (default 120 s, configurable, 0 disables the whole feature) and
by ComfyUI's own `load_models_gpu()`, which sizes its loads against the VRAM it
actually finds free. That degradation path is *reasoned*, not measured — see the
handover notes.

Also not covered, deliberately:

  * **A CUDA scoring pass** (face similarity / quality, `gpu_exclusive_vision_window`
    with `device == 'cuda'`). It is not in the contention signal and does not
    revoke. Two reasons: it announces itself with `vision_in_progress`, the very
    flag the isolated vision calls set for *themselves* — reading it would make
    the policy answer "contended" for the flagship head-crop case, which runs
    inside such a window. And its footprint (a few GB of torch) is nothing like
    ComfyUI's 19 GB, so a stale lease costs it some headroom for at most
    `warm_seconds()`, not a silent CPU spill. Revisit if the signal ever gains a
    dedicated flag.
  * **An LDS restart.** The lease is process-local state; after a restart the
    model may stay resident for the remainder of its Ollama-side TTL with no
    lease to revoke. Bounded by the same `warm_seconds()`.

Why "unknown" means "unload"
----------------------------
Every failure to read the contention signal resolves to *contended*. `keep_alive=0`
is exactly today's behaviour, so an unreadable signal degrades to the status quo
instead of to a 7.5 GB gamble. A policy that guesses "probably free" when it
cannot tell would trade a predictable reload for an unpredictable eviction, which
is the trade this module exists to avoid.
