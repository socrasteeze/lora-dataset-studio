"""Cloud LoRA training orchestrator (vast.ai ephemeral pod).

State machine (CloudTrainingRun.status):
  preparing -> provisioning -> uploading -> training -> downloading
  -> terminating -> done | stopped | error | error_pod_kept

Lifecycle invariant: ordinary LoRA exits, explicit user stops and max-runtime
caps destroy the instance. Once dense Krea training has started, unexpected
failure keeps the pod recoverable until its direct Hugging Face delivery and
licence metadata are verified; only then may completion destroy it. The local
training path is untouched: a cloud run never sets 'training_in_progress', so
local generation/captioning stay available."""

    The placement is the design. A pod is billed from boot, and whether its image
    can decode these mp4s is genuinely unknown: OpenCV's bundled ffmpeg has no
    software AV1 decoder, PyAV is absent from some images, and an image without
    libGL cannot import cv2 at all. Each of those ends the same way — a job that

    already-booted pod; discovered later it costs the run. This is run #138's
    lesson one step further along: the phase you do not observe is the phase that
    bills you.

    A refusal RAISES, and the monitor's generic handler turns it into a failed
    run with the pod released. Standing down "just in case the probe is wrong"
    would restore exactly the blind launch this exists to remove.

    DIVERGENCE 4 — the probe itself (`pod_video_probe`) is the rented-pod lane

    ever reached the body, and no video run can be launched at a pod from this

    two consecutive tails end on different bars, and a fingerprint built from
    the last one alone flips A(1.0G) → B(2.0G) → A(1.0G) forever while BOTH
    files sit frozen. It would report movement on a dead pod — the freeze
    watchdog would then never fire on the one case it exists for. Summing per

    It belongs here for exactly the reason the download bytes do: it is the
    only reading that separates a 24 GB upload that is merely slow from one
    that has stopped moving. A restart restarts the upload from zero, which

    above chooses, and the reason a re-adopted run is never killed on its
    predecessor's byte count.

# progress (a pod frozen in 'loading' reports 'loading' forever), and a line

    #    minutes (its full 2000-step run was ~84 min), so the default is
    #    generous enough to survive an honestly slow download.
    #    The step counter is NOT the only progress signal in that phase:
    #    the pod's log carries the base-model download's byte counter,

    #    26.3 GB at the 2.58 MB/s measured on another pod is ~2 h 50, so

    images are the union of its checkpoints' images, so two independent readers
    would be two chances to disagree about what exists.

    for is judging where the LoRA stopped getting better, and that judgement
    starts at the end. Inside a step the app's rule is unchanged — newest first.

    ``step: null`` is a real group, LAST: images attributable to this RUN but not
    to a step (a step-less final save carries the run tag in its name and no
    step). They used to be counted as "not traced back to a checkpoint", which

    These rows ARE the Test Studio's cells: one image lives in exactly one place
    in the database and is shown by two surfaces. So "remove it from this
    gallery" and "delete it" cannot both be true, and hiding it here while it
    stays in the Studio grid would only move the confusion. The gallery deletes
    for real, and the confirmation says the Test Studio loses them too — the
    consequence is stated BEFORE the click, not discovered after it.

    Nothing is destroyed outright: the file goes through ``trash.dispose`` (OS
    recycle bin → the app's own trash → a permanent unlink only if both refuse),
    exactly like the bank's rejected sweep. ``checkpoint_gallery`` reports the
    mode up front and this returns the mode actually used.

    Scoped to the checkpoint: an id that is not linked to (record_id, step) is
    refused, so this route cannot be turned into "delete any image by id".

    ``step=None`` widens the scope to the WHOLE RUN — every step of it plus the
    step-less group — which is what the run gallery deletes with. It is the same
    function on purpose: two delete paths over the same rows would be two places
    to keep the recycle-bin promise, the shared-file rule and the "generating is
    never cancelled" rule true, and they would drift.

    ``record_id=None`` removes the scope entirely — the app-wide 🖼 Gallery
    (``delete_gallery_images``), whose feed spans every run and therefore has
    no record to be scoped by. The per-checkpoint ROUTES never pass None here,
    so their "not ours to delete" refusal is unchanged.

    Degrades instead of failing, because the gallery of a real install is never
    tidy:
      • a row still generating keeps its file (skipped 'generating') — cancelling
        someone's running job is not what a delete click asked for;
      • a row whose file is already gone from disk still loses its row;
      • a file another surviving row also points at is unlinked from THIS row but
        left on disk (no surface loses a picture it still lists);
      • a file that cannot be moved keeps its row, so it stays visible and
        retryable rather than vanishing from the UI while it sits on disk.

    ``CheckpointPreview`` rows pointing at a deleted image are removed in the
    same transaction. The reader already drops a dangling pointer, but leaving
    one behind means a checkpoint silently falls back to an older preview with no
    trace of why — and the row would outlive every image it could ever resolve.

    """Remove a GONE run from the lineage graph, with EVERYTHING that only
    existed because of it. Five tables carry a `record_id`; leaving three of
    them behind is how a "deleted" run keeps haunting the canvas and the
    checkpoint gallery.

    What goes, and why it goes that way:
      • `TrainingRunRecord` + its `CheckpointNote`s + its `CheckpointPreview`
        links (a checkpoint may hold several previews since the uniqueness
        constraint was lifted) + its `CanvasNodePosition` (a board coordinate
        for a card that no longer exists);
      • children that resumed FROM this run are DETACHED (parent_record_id →
        NULL), staying in the graph as honest "origin unknown" roots;
      • `LoraTestImage` rows are UNLINKED (`record_id`/`step` → NULL), never
        deleted. Those are real generated pictures that also live in the Test
        Studio and the canvas gallery; removing a run is a tidying of lineage,
        not an order to destroy images the user never said to destroy. They lose
        their provenance, and the confirmation dialog says so up front;
      • archived source blobs are released ONLY when this run was their last
        referrer (`_releasable_blob_sigs`) — the store is shared between runs and
        a naive delete would blank another run's comparison.

    Guards kept: a run whose checkpoints are still on disk is REFUSED
    ('has_saves') so a recoverable run is never discarded from under the user.

    `cascade=True` is the ONE caller allowed past that guard:
    ``run_cascade_delete.delete_run_cascade`` has just moved those checkpoints to
    the trash itself, so re-asking "are they on disk?" would either refuse a
    deletion whose files are already gone or race a slow filesystem. It is a
    keyword with a False default so every existing caller keeps the conservative
    behaviour byte for byte — the cascade is an explicitly requested mode, never
    a new default that starts destroying files under code that never asked.

    Returns 'not_found' | 'has_saves' | 'deleted' | 'conflict'. The FK children
    (no relationship cascade in this schema) are deleted and FLUSHED before the
    parent row so SQLite never raises the repo's "delete 500" IntegrityError; a
    stray one is caught and reported as 'conflict', never a 500. Blobs are
    touched only AFTER the commit succeeds — a filesystem hiccup must never roll
    back a database deletion, and vice versa."""

# card off it. These three functions are the whole persistence story: read the
# board's overrides, upsert some, drop a lane's. Everything about WHICH cards get
# a row and where they land is decided client-side by the pure placement layer
# (frontend/src/utils/canvasPlacement.js) — the server stores coordinates and
# asks no questions, so the geometry stays testable without a browser.
#
# Positions are a display preference. A failed write must never interrupt what
# the user is doing (design: "nothing about the canvas may block the canvas"),
# which is why these are plain, boring upserts with no side effects.
