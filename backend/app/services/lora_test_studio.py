"""LoRA Test Studio: checkpoint/strength sweeps with fixed seeds and prompts.

Generate comparison grids for a trained dataset, collect votes and persist
winning settings. Commit each row before enqueueing to avoid orphan jobs.
Queue metadata marks is_lora_test; completion/failure/cancellation links through
link_completed_test_image at the same hook as dataset jobs. Move completed files
into the dataset folder. Runs are free, with one active run per dataset, and
cannot start while training or vision owns the GPU.

Cell counts have no hard cap: the serial queue and UI count/time estimate let
users choose the workload. MAX_TEST_IMAGES is a frontend warning threshold,
not an enforced limit.

Workflow paths resolve under cfg.BACKEND_DIR/workflows; ComfyUI output uses a
live accessor. This single-user app omits the original project's ownership and
gallery-history subsystems. Exact dataset trigger boundaries identify deployed
checkpoints, and every test-image row belongs to the local user."""

    A derived row (see CANVAS_IMAGE_IMPROVE) is in the same table and must not be
    read as a cell. Auditing the 21 read sites found TEN that break otherwise,
    and none of them is theoretical:

      * `_active_run_count` counts pending rows with no file, so an improve still
        rendering answered "a test run is already in progress" and BLOCKED every
        new Test Studio launch;
      * the resume path picks up cancelled/failed rows by dataset and would have
        re-queued a failed improve as a Z-Image cell — wrong workflow, wrong
        engine;
      * `cell_scores` / `model_net_scores` aggregate by (checkpoint, strength, …),
        so a 👍 given to an UPSCALE in the gallery became a vote for the
        checkpoint that did not produce it;
      * `best_cell` and its per-checkpoint sibling take `order_by(id.desc())`, so
        the improvement — newest by construction — became the representative
        image of the winning config;
      * the face-scoring pass would spend GPU on it and `face_ranking` would
        average its score into its checkpoint's.

    So the filter is not a detail of one query, it is the meaning of "cell", and
    it lives in ONE place. `test_canvas_image_improve.py` forbids a bare
    `LoraTestImage.query` anywhere else in this module, so a future reader cannot
    reintroduce the leak by writing the obvious thing. A query that legitimately
    needs every row carries a `lds-allow-bare-lora-test-query:` comment saying
    why — the four that exist today all resolve ONE row by `job_id`, and the
    completion callback is among them: filtering derived rows out of it would
    leave every improvement pending forever.

    ⚠️ WHERE THIS HELPER MUST **NOT** BE USED — this boundary is the feature.
    `services/cloud_training.py` (checkpoint_gallery, run_gallery,
    canvas_image_nodes) and `services/gallery_download.py` read the SAME table and
    deliberately do NOT filter these rows out: showing the improvement in the
    gallery it was made from, next to its source, and letting it be pinned onto
    the board, IS what the ✨ button was asked for. "Harmonising" by applying this
    helper there would silently delete the feature, so a test pins both
    directions: absent from the studio's cells, present in the checkpoint gallery
    and pinnable.

#     `krea2_turbo_fp8_scaled.safetensors`; ComfyUI validates a loader widget by
#     exact string match against the list it publishes, and those two names are
#     not the same string. So on an install that simply followed Setup, the
#     Studio's default base named a file that is not there and the whole prompt
#     was refused ("Value not in list: unet_name") before a step ran. It worked
#     only on machines that happened to have that community repack.
#   * That repack carries tensors this family does not declare. Measured on the
#     real header: 432 tensors against the family's 430, the two extras being
#     `last.down.weight` / `last.up.weight` `[6144, 6144]`, which its own
#     `__metadata__` (`egg_format`, `egg_w`, `egg_h`, `egg_c`) describes as an

    the first cell write and retained through the cell + queue commit.  This

    cells, or read origin from the deployment tag (see checkpoint_origins).
    All cells share run_id and seed for fairness. Use the shared `prompt` when
    provided, otherwise each cell's dataset identity_prompt with its own trigger.
    One selection produces a single-LoRA run.

    Generate parity (2026-07-01): all cells share always-on LoRAs, SDXL steps2
    and global negative/sampler/scheduler/precision/detail/tier settings, gated
    and validated by family through _sanitize_gen_knobs.

    `combine=True` with at least two selections switches from comparison
    (one LoRA alone per cell) to a stack: load selected LoRAs together with
    each selection's `weight` and inject all dataset triggers. Replace the
    `strengths` axis with the head LoRA's weight, since each member has its own
    weight. A run still uses one family: mixing Krea and SDXL is rejected with
    a message naming the incompatible families and their bases/workflows.

    `external_loras` (Canvas plugin nodes) accepts [{filename, strength}] from
    any models/loras file and stacks them on every cell through `extra_loras`,
    without restricting them to the family pool. Missing files are hard errors,
