"""🗣 What HAPPENS in a shot — the caption pass, and the text two features read.

A caption here does two jobs, and the second is the one that makes it worth the
GPU time: it is the text the 🔎 hybrid search matches literally, AND it is what
the promotion writes into a clip's `.txt` sidecar — which IS the training prompt.
The CLIP pass (video_clip_search.py) already finds what a moment LOOKS like; no
frame carries "turns and walks away", because that is a fact about time.

⛔ NOT OLLAMA. It fails silently on video on this machine — an empty response,
no error. See infer/video_caption_infer.py for the whole reasoning and for what
was verified locally before any of this was written.

FRAMES DECODED HERE, MODEL RUN THERE, exactly like the embedding pass: PyAV is
in the Flask venv and torch is not. The frame extraction reuses that pass's own
seam (`video_clip_search._write_frames`) at a larger size — a captioner reads
faces, text and gesture where an embedder needs a thumbnail — and the frames are
deleted with the caption that replaced them.

SAMPLED ACROSS THE WHOLE SHOT, not around its middle. Eight frames spanning the
span is what makes an ACTION visible; three frames from the centre describe a
moment and would lose the very thing this pass exists for.

A GENERATED CAPTION IS A DRAFT. `caption_state` tells 'ok' (generated) from
'edited' (a human corrected it), and a bulk re-run skips 'edited' rows. Losing a
correction to the next pass is the one thing that would stop anyone from ever
making one — so overwriting a human's words requires asking for it by name.

# WHAT THE TRAINER READS. ai-toolkit reads the `.txt` next to the clip as the
# sample's prompt, verbatim — `caption_ext: "txt"` in its own shipped video
# configs (C:\ai-toolkit\config\examples\train_lora_wan22_14b_24gb.yaml:30), and
# `clean_caption` in C:\ai-toolkit\toolkit\dataloader_mixins.py:98-109 does
# nothing at all (every normalising line in it is commented out). So whatever is
# written here IS the prompt, punctuation and preamble included.
#
# Hence two demands in the prompt below that look like style and are not:
#   * ACTION FIRST. A video model learns what happens between the first frame and
#     the last. "A woman in a red coat. A street. A car." is a caption for a
#     photograph and teaches the motion nothing.
#   * NO PREAMBLE. Every caption beginning "This video shows" teaches the model
#     that phrase. Stripping it later is a find-and-replace nobody remembers to
#     run, so it is refused twice — asked for here, and cleaned in clean_caption.
_PROMPT = (
    'Describe what happens in this video clip, in one or two plain sentences. '
    'Lead with the ACTION and how it unfolds — who or what moves, and how — then '
    'the setting and the look. Include camera movement when there is any (pans, '
    'tilts, push in, handheld). Do not begin with "This video shows" or any '
    'similar preamble, do not list objects as an inventory, and do not mention '
    'the frames or the video itself. Write it as a caption, not as a report.'
)

# ── The second prompt, and the measurement that produced it ──────────────────
# The model was made configurable first, on the theory that the checkpoint
# decided how plainly a caption described its footage. An A/B on real material
# said otherwise:
#
#   base model    + this standard prompt           -> evasive, circled the subject
#   uncensored 8B + this standard prompt           -> barely better, hid behind
#                                                     the camera
#   uncensored 8B + the permission prompt below    -> named things precisely
#   BASE model    + the permission prompt below    -> named things precisely too,
#                                                     with the best action writing
#
# The dominant lock is the PROMPT. A captioner describes what it has been given
# permission to describe, and the prompt above never granted it — so the base
# model, asked properly, outperformed an uncensored one asked the old way.
#
# TWO CLAUSES CARRY THE DIFFERENCE and both are pinned by tests: name what is
# visible and what occurs, and do NOT substitute the two words the measurement
# caught it hiding behind. A later tidy-up of this wording would quietly restore
# the euphemism, which is a dataset defect rather than a style regression: a
# caption that talks around its footage teaches the trained model to look away,
# and the output reads perfectly well either way.
