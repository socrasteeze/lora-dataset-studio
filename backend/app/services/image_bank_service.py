"""Image bank service — triage a big unsorted folder into dataset-ready
selections.

The founding use case: "I exported 9 000 images from Telegram — now what?".
A bank references that folder IN PLACE (no copy, the source files are never
written to) and layers a funnel on top:

  1. inventory      — instant: walk the folder, register every image file;
  2. quality pass   — background thread, CPU/pure-PIL: sharpness, noise,
                      uniformity, dimensions, dHash + duplicate groups;
                      raw scores persist, FLAGS are computed at read time
                      against the config thresholds ('bank' section) so
                      recalibrating never needs a rescan;
  3. duplicates     — near-duplicate groups (same 64-bit dHash family as the
                      dataset import dedup) with keep-best / keep-first /
                      manual resolution — losers are REJECTED (a status),
                      never deleted from disk;
  4. subject pass   — optional, needs the face-scoring extra: InsightFace
                      embeddings (cached in an .npz next to the thumbs) +
                      person clustering, to sort a mixed dump by WHO is in
                      the frame without any reference photo;
  5. promotion      — the kept selection is COPIED into a dataset through the
                      normal import path (normalize to webp + perceptual
                      dedup vs the dataset), inheriting every downstream tool
                      (captions, watermarks, face scoring, training).

Long passes run through bank_jobs (one background thread per bank, polled via
the bank payload) — a 9 000-image folder must scan in minutes without ever
holding an HTTP request open or freezing the UI.

    relevant score (worst first) so the review reads top-down.

    that OVERRIDES every facet/sort (the selection IS the scope) and renders the

# The bank's folder belongs to the user and is never written to, so "cleaning a
# watermark" here means writing a SEPARATE cleaned blob under the bank's own
# working directory (clean/<image_id>.webp) and pointing the readers at it
# (resolved_image_path). The original therefore stays untouched by construction,
# which is what makes undo trivial and both levels risk-free.
#
# The escalation is deliberate and each level is launched BY HAND:
#   level 1 — ✂ auto-crop: CPU/PIL, invents no pixel. Only touches marks the
#             dataset router calls croppable (inside a border band, and the crop
#             still leaves a usable image). Everything else is left flagged.
#   level 2 — inpaint: LaMa (fast, non-generative) or Klein (ComfyUI, handles
#             on-subject marks) over what is STILL flagged. allow_crop=False, so
#             a border mark that level 1 skipped (or that the user never cropped)
#             is repainted rather than cropped — level 2 is the "repaint what's
#             left" lane, not a second router.
# Both reuse the dataset routing/engines verbatim; nothing about the decision
# logic is re-implemented here.

# --- "Launch all" pipeline --------------------------------------------------
# The overnight funnel: the user configures it once, hits Launch all, and comes
# back to a triaged, optionally pre-captioned bank. It chains the EXISTING passes
# in the validated order. Each pass already filters status != 'reject', so
# running auto-reject BEFORE the heavy passes means score/watermark/person only
# ever touch the SURVIVORS — the costly work never pays for images we just
# dropped (the deliberate cost/quality trade-off: duplicate "keep best" therefore
# ranks on sharpness/size, not the aesthetic score that isn't computed yet).
PIPELINE_STEPS = ('scan', 'auto_reject', 'score', 'semantic_dedup', 'watermark',
                  'faces', 'framing', 'caption')
# Auto-reject inside the pipeline runs right after the quality scan, so it can
# only act on the CPU-scan flags (and duplicates). The score-derived flags
# (low_aesthetic/nsfw/watermark) have no data yet at that point.
#
# NOT every quality flag, though. `soft_detail` and `bars` are excluded ON
# PURPOSE — they are provenance HINTS, not verdicts, and their own documentation
# says so: a crisp watermark rescues an enlargement's detail ratio while a
# motion-blurred native shot sinks it, and `bars` fires on any dark-themed
# screenshot. The standalone 🧹 Auto-reject button still offers them, because
# there a human is looking at the flagged count, can undo on the spot, and the
# hint under the checkbox says "check before mass-rejecting". The pipeline is the
# opposite situation: unattended, and auto-reject runs FIRST, so anything it
# drops never reaches the score / watermark / caption passes at all — the mistake
# becomes invisible instead of reviewable. Offering a non-verdict as an overnight
# bulk rejection contradicts the measurement it is built on.
