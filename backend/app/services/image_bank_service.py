"""🗃️ Image bank service — triage a big unsorted folder into dataset-ready
selections.

The founding use case: "I exported 9 000 images from Telegram — now what?".
A bank references that folder IN PLACE (no copy, the source files are never
written to) and layers a funnel on top:

  1. inventory      — instant: walk the folder, register every image file;
  2. quality pass   — background thread, CPU/pure-PIL: sharpness, noise,
                      uniformity, dimensions, dHash + duplicate groups;
                      raw scores persist, FLAGS are computed at read time
                      against the config thresholds ('bank' section) so
                      recalibrating never needs a rescan;
  3. duplicates     — near-duplicate groups (same 64-bit dHash family as the
                      dataset import dedup) with keep-best / keep-first /
                      manual resolution — losers are REJECTED (a status),
                      never deleted from disk;
  4. subject pass   — optional, needs the face-scoring extra: InsightFace
                      embeddings (cached in an .npz next to the thumbs) +
                      person clustering, to sort a mixed dump by WHO is in
                      the frame without any reference photo;
  5. promotion      — the kept selection is COPIED into a dataset through the
                      normal import path (normalize to webp + perceptual
                      dedup vs the dataset), inheriting every downstream tool
                      (captions, watermarks, face scoring, training).

Long passes run through bank_jobs (one background thread per bank, polled via
the bank payload) — a 9 000-image folder must scan in minutes without ever
holding an HTTP request open or freezing the UI.

    caption AND the relpath — so captions double as searchable tags for a big dump
    ("red dress"), combinable with every other filter. Flag filters sort by the
    relevant score (worst first) so the review reads top-down.
    ``sort`` (a GRID_SORTS id — resolution / aesthetic / sharpness, each way)
    overrides that order: resolution ranks on megapixels (width×height, so
    900×900 outranks 1200×300), aesthetic on the ✨ Score rating, sharpness on
    the 🔎 Scan Laplacian variance. Rows the matching pass never reached (NULL)
    always sink to the end, in BOTH directions. It composes with every filter,
    and — since "Select all in filter" / ▶ Review page this SAME endpoint — the
    selection walks the order the user is looking at.
    ``res_bucket`` (a _RES_BUCKETS id) narrows to one resolution tier — a
    half-open [lo, hi) megapixel band — and composes with every filter AND the
    sort (the tier + Resolution↑/↓ combo is the mixed-dump cleanup flow).
    ``ids`` is the "show selected" VIEW: an explicit ordered list of image ids
    that OVERRIDES every facet/sort (the selection IS the scope) and renders the
    page in the SAME order the caller passed — so a similarity ranking from

    """How ALONE each row is, as (m,) floats in [0, 1] — 0 for anything at or above
    the pool's median local density, 1 for the genuinely isolated tail.

    Local density = mean cosine similarity to the ``k`` nearest OTHER rows (the
    same cached embeddings the whole curation lane uses). Turning that density
    into a penalty is done on a ROBUST scale — median and MAD, not min/max — for
    two reasons that matter here:

      • a single meme in 24 000 photos would own the whole min/max range and
        squash every real difference to nothing;
      • everything at or above the median density gets penalty exactly 0, so the
        normal population of the bank is left strictly untouched. This selector
        DISCOUNTS the isolated tail, it never REWARDS the centre — which is what
        keeps a typicality guard from quietly turning "the 60 most varied" into
        60 look-alikes from the middle of the cloud.

    The ramp is quadratic, so being *slightly* below the median density barely
    costs anything and only the real tail is hit hard: at 1 robust deviation the
    penalty is 0.11, at 2 it is 0.44, at 3 and beyond it saturates at 1.

    Memory: the similarity pass runs in row blocks, so peak allocation is
    (block × m) float32 (~49 MB at m=24 000, measured 148 MB peak including
    temporaries) instead of the ~2.3 GB a full ``E @ E.T`` would need.
    Deterministic — median/MAD/partition, no sampling, no RNG.

    Time: this is an exact all-pairs pass, Θ(m²·d) — the same shape of work the
    semantic-dedup stage already does, and the reason the guard is computed ONLY
    when it is on. It is also, by a wide margin, the most expensive thing a
    curation click does; ``_sim_block`` explains why the product goes through
    scipy's BLAS rather than numpy's (12.6 s → 0.14 s on a 6 353-image pool,
    measured — the numpy this app ships on has no optimised BLAS, so the "~50×
    slower" case that paragraph used to describe as a hazard WAS the normal one).
    An approximation (subsampling the reference set) was rejected on purpose: it
    would make a small but legitimate group — eight shots of one rare outfit —
    look isolated and get penalised, which is exactly the variety this selector

    """Farthest-point sampling over the ✨ Score CLIP embeddings, tempered by a
    TYPICALITY guard: the ``n`` images of the (filtered) pool that best COVER the
    visual space — the antidote to a dump of 4 000 near-identical shots. Greedy
    FPS: seed with the lowest-id row (deterministic), then repeatedly add the
    point whose nearest already-chosen neighbour is FARTHEST (max-min cosine
    distance). The SAMPLING itself is O(n·m·d) — one (m×d)·(d,) product per pick,
    110 ms at m=6 353 / n=60 (measured).

    That figure used to be quoted as the cost of the WHOLE call ("~sub-second
    even at m=24 000"), and on real data it was wrong by a factor of thirty: the
    click took 32 s, of which the loop below was 0.1 s. The rest was the guard's
    all-pairs pass (see ``_isolation_penalty`` / ``_sim_block``). Whatever else
    changes here, keep this docstring measured — a comment promising a second
    where the user waits half a minute is a debt, not documentation.

    ``typicality`` (0–1) exists because pure max-min distance is, mathematically,
    the criterion that prefers ISOLATED points: on a collected bank the first
    picks are therefore structurally biased towards the aberrations (a meme, a
    photo of someone else, a botched frame) rather than towards variety of the
    subject. Each candidate's novelty is multiplied by
    ``10 ** (-3 × typicality × isolation)`` (see ``_isolation_penalty``), so an
    image still gets picked for the variety it adds, but being alone stops being
    a quality in itself. The discount is GEOMETRIC on purpose: an aberration's
    distance advantage over a normal image is a ratio (2–4× in practice, and it
    grows as the easy variety gets used up), so a merely linear penalty would need
    a near-maximal setting to ever bite.

      • 0    → EXACTLY the historical behaviour, pick for pick (the guard is not
               even computed);
      • 0.5  → the default: a saturated outlier keeps ~3% of its novelty (÷32) —
               decisively beaten by any genuinely varied shot — while a merely
               below-average image (penalty 0.11) keeps 68%;
      • 1    → the isolated tail is all but excluded (÷1000).

    The guard is bounded on BOTH sides: rows at or above the median density are
    never penalised at all (factor exactly 1.0), so it cannot collapse the
    selection into look-alikes from the middle of the cloud.

# watermark" here means writing a SEPARATE cleaned blob under the bank's own
# working directory (clean/<image_id>.webp) and pointing the readers at it
# (resolved_image_path). The original therefore stays untouched by construction,
# which is what makes undo trivial and both levels risk-free.
#
# The escalation is deliberate and each level is launched BY HAND:
#   level 1 — ✂ auto-crop: CPU/PIL, invents no pixel. Only touches marks the
#             dataset router calls croppable (inside a border band, and the crop
#             still leaves a usable image). Everything else is left flagged.
#   level 2 — 🧽 inpaint: LaMa (fast, non-generative) or Klein (ComfyUI, handles
#             on-subject marks) over what is STILL flagged. allow_crop=False, so
#             a border mark that level 1 skipped (or that the user never cropped)
#             is repainted rather than cropped — level 2 is the "repaint what's
#             left" lane, not a second router.
# Both reuse the dataset routing/engines verbatim; nothing about the decision
# logic is re-implemented here.

# running auto-reject BEFORE the heavy passes means score/watermark/person only
# ever touch the SURVIVORS — the costly work never pays for images we just
# dropped (the deliberate cost/quality trade-off: duplicate "keep best" therefore
# ranks on sharpness/size, not the aesthetic score that isn't computed yet).

# only act on the CPU-scan flags (and duplicates). The score-derived flags
# (low_aesthetic/nsfw/watermark) have no data yet at that point.
#
# NOT every quality flag, though. `soft_detail` and `bars` are excluded ON
# PURPOSE — they are provenance HINTS, not verdicts, and their own documentation
# says so: a crisp watermark rescues an enlargement's detail ratio while a
# motion-blurred native shot sinks it, and `bars` fires on any dark-themed
# screenshot. The standalone 🧹 Auto-reject button still offers them, because
# there a human is looking at the flagged count, can undo on the spot, and the
# hint under the checkbox says "check before mass-rejecting". The pipeline is the
# opposite situation: unattended, and auto-reject runs FIRST, so anything it
# drops never reaches the score / watermark / caption passes at all — the mistake
# becomes invisible instead of reviewable. Offering a non-verdict as an overnight
# bulk rejection contradicts the measurement it is built on.
