"""🗃️ Image bank service — triage a big unsorted folder into dataset-ready
selections.

The founding use case: "I exported 9 000 images from Telegram — now what?".
A bank references that folder IN PLACE (no copy, the source files are never
written to) and layers a funnel on top:

  1. inventory      — instant: walk the folder, register every image file;
  2. quality pass   — background thread, CPU/pure-PIL: sharpness, noise,
                      uniformity, dimensions, dHash + duplicate groups;
                      raw scores persist, FLAGS are computed at read time
                      against the config thresholds ('bank' section) so
                      recalibrating never needs a rescan;
  3. duplicates     — near-duplicate groups (same 64-bit dHash family as the
                      dataset import dedup) with keep-best / keep-first /
                      manual resolution — losers are REJECTED (a status),
                      never deleted from disk;
  4. subject pass   — optional, needs the face-scoring extra: InsightFace
                      embeddings (cached in an .npz next to the thumbs) +
                      person clustering, to sort a mixed dump by WHO is in
                      the frame without any reference photo;
  5. promotion      — the kept selection enters a dataset through the configured
                      import policy (raw-preserve by default, optional WebP
                      normalisation) + perceptual dedup, inheriting every downstream tool
                      (captions, watermarks, face scoring, training).

Long passes run through bank_jobs (one background thread per bank, polled via
the bank payload) — a 9 000-image folder must scan in minutes without ever
holding an HTTP request open or freezing the UI.

    the per-subfolder banks, so descending would re-import every image they own.
    Pruning here rather than at each call site is deliberate — the two callers
    (create and refresh) must agree about what a root_only bank contains, and a

    drive or a renamed folder would otherwise wipe a whole triage in one silent

#     because CLIP reads a picture's SUBJECT as much as its medium, so a
#     photograph of somebody cosplaying an anime character scores as 'anime'.
#     That confusion is the whole reason the non-photo bar is where it is.

    """One PAGE of the bank grid (a 9 000-image bank must never ship whole).
    Filters compose: status ∩ flag ∩ cluster ∩ dup-group ∩ style ∩ subfolder ∩ tags ∩ search.
    ``search`` is a plain full-text term matched (case-insensitive LIKE) against the
    caption, the relpath AND the 🔖 WD14 tags — so a big dump is searchable
    ("red dress") whether it was captioned, tagged, or both; a two-word term is
    also tried with an underscore, because booru tags are written `red_dress` and
    nobody types them that way. Combinable with every other filter.
    ``exclude`` is the INVERSE of that search and the reason both live here: a
    comma-separated list of terms, each HIDING the images whose caption, path or
    tags mention it. Searching answers "where is X"; excluding answers "what have
    I not done yet", which is how a captioned bank gets worked through as a
    checklist. Uncaptioned rows are never hidden by it (see _text_match).
    ``tags`` is the 🏷️ chip filter, matching a WORD of the caption or path.
    ``wd14_tags`` is the separate 🔖 facet filter: a list of WHOLE WD14 tag names,
    ANDed, matched against `tags_text` only. Two filters, two parameters, on
    purpose — the chips come from a caption's own words and the facets come from
    the tagger's vocabulary, so folding them into one key would make each one
    silently answer the other's question. Facet matching is whole-tag only —
    `blonde_hair` never matches `blonde_hair_ribbon`.
    Flag filters sort by the relevant score (worst first) so the review reads
    top-down. ``sort`` (a GRID_SORTS id) overrides that order and covers EVERY
    quantity the passes persist — resolution (megapixels, so 900×900 outranks
    1200×300), file size, aesthetic rating, NSFW probability, sharpness, noise,
    flatness, detail ratio, letterbox bars, JPEG quality, face confidence — each
    way. Rows the matching pass never reached (NULL) always sink to the end, in
    BOTH directions (see _sort_order). It composes with every filter,
    and — since "Select all in filter" / ▶ Review page this SAME endpoint — the
    selection walks the order the user is looking at.
    ``res_bucket`` (a _RES_BUCKETS id) narrows to one resolution tier — a
    half-open [lo, hi) megapixel band — and composes with every filter AND the
    sort (the tier + Resolution↑/↓ combo is the mixed-dump cleanup flow).
    ``medium`` (a MEDIUM_KEYS id) narrows to one medium — what the picture is
    MADE of, from the 🎨 Medium pass — including 'unsure', which is a real
    verdict and has to be reachable. ``angle`` (an ANGLES id) narrows to one head
    angle, recomputed from the stored yaw at read time. Both compose with
    everything, like every other facet.
    ``reason`` (a REASON_KEYS id) narrows to the images rejected FOR that reason
    — the ✕ Rejected sub-facet, including 'unrecorded' for rows rejected before
    the column meant anything. It carries `status == 'reject'` inside its own
    predicate, so it composes with everything and never rewrites the status
    facet. This is the way back to a pile a bulk action has already closed: 🧹
    Auto-reject and "Resolve ALL duplicates" both end with nothing left to
    resolve, so the ≈ chip correctly reads 0 while thousands of images sit in
    the bin. Read-only — it selects, it never un-rejects.
    ``ids`` is the "show selected" VIEW: an explicit ordered list of image ids
    that OVERRIDES every facet/sort (the selection IS the scope) and renders the
    page in the SAME order the caller passed — so a similarity ranking from
    ``select_similar`` shows reference-first, closest-to-farthest, instead of the
    default id order. Unknown/foreign ids are dropped silently."""

    without a second code path.

    Why this exists. The payload's numbers are bank-wide, which was RIGHT for the
    question they were built to answer ("clicking this chip shows exactly these
    rows") and became wrong the moment any other facet was on. Measured on a
    50 397-image bank with ✕ Rejected picked: the chips offered "📺 Noisy 1 136"
    and "🔞 NSFW 20 540" over grids of 527 and 3 364 rows. Those numbers were
    never lies about the bank; they had simply stopped describing anything the

# decided against. It is never a default, never part of the default, and the

    """How ALONE each row is, as (m,) floats in [0, 1] — 0 for anything at or above
    the pool's median local density, 1 for the genuinely isolated tail.

    Local density = mean cosine similarity to the ``k`` nearest OTHER rows (the
    same cached embeddings the whole curation lane uses). Turning that density
    into a penalty is done on a ROBUST scale — median and MAD, not min/max — for
    two reasons that matter here:

      • a single meme in 24 000 photos would own the whole min/max range and
        squash every real difference to nothing;
      • everything at or above the median density gets penalty exactly 0, so the
        normal population of the bank is left strictly untouched. This selector
        DISCOUNTS the isolated tail, it never REWARDS the centre — which is what
        keeps a typicality guard from quietly turning "the 60 most varied" into
        60 look-alikes from the middle of the cloud.

    The ramp is quadratic, so being *slightly* below the median density barely
    costs anything and only the real tail is hit hard: at 1 robust deviation the
    penalty is 0.11, at 2 it is 0.44, at 3 and beyond it saturates at 1.

    Memory: the similarity pass runs in row blocks, so peak allocation is
    (block × m) float32 (~49 MB at m=24 000, measured 148 MB peak including
    temporaries) instead of the ~2.3 GB a full ``E @ E.T`` would need.
    Deterministic — median/MAD/partition, no sampling, no RNG.

    Time: this is an exact all-pairs pass, Θ(m²·d) — the same shape of work the
    semantic-dedup stage already does, and the reason the guard is computed ONLY
    when it is on. It is also, by a wide margin, the most expensive thing a
    curation click does; ``_sim_block`` explains why the product goes through
    scipy's BLAS rather than numpy's (12.6 s → 0.14 s on a 6 353-image pool,
    measured — the numpy this app ships on has no optimised BLAS, so the "~50×
    slower" case that paragraph used to describe as a hazard WAS the normal one).

    TYPICALITY guard: the ``n`` images of the (filtered) pool that best COVER the
    visual space — the antidote to a dump of 4 000 near-identical shots. Greedy
    FPS: seed with the lowest-id row (deterministic), then repeatedly add the
    point whose nearest already-chosen neighbour is FARTHEST (max-min cosine
    distance). The SAMPLING itself is O(n·m·d) — one (m×d)·(d,) product per pick,
    110 ms at m=6 353 / n=60 (measured).

    That figure used to be quoted as the cost of the WHOLE call ("~sub-second
    even at m=24 000"), and on real data it was wrong by a factor of thirty: the
    click took 32 s, of which the loop below was 0.1 s. The rest was the guard's
    all-pairs pass (see ``_isolation_penalty`` / ``_sim_block``). Whatever else
    changes here, keep this docstring measured — a comment promising a second
    where the user waits half a minute is a debt, not documentation.

    ``typicality`` (0–1) exists because pure max-min distance is, mathematically,
    the criterion that prefers ISOLATED points: on a collected bank the first
    picks are therefore structurally biased towards the aberrations (a meme, a
    photo of someone else, a botched frame) rather than towards variety of the
    subject. Each candidate's novelty is multiplied by
    ``10 ** (-3 × typicality × isolation)`` (see ``_isolation_penalty``), so an
    image still gets picked for the variety it adds, but being alone stops being
    a quality in itself. The discount is GEOMETRIC on purpose: an aberration's
    distance advantage over a normal image is a ratio (2–4× in practice, and it
    grows as the easy variety gets used up), so a merely linear penalty would need
    a near-maximal setting to ever bite.

      • 0    → EXACTLY the historical behaviour, pick for pick (the guard is not
               even computed);
      • 0.5  → the default: a saturated outlier keeps ~3% of its novelty (÷32) —
               decisively beaten by any genuinely varied shot — while a merely
               below-average image (penalty 0.11) keeps 68%;
      • 1    → the isolated tail is all but excluded (÷1000).

    The guard is bounded on BOTH sides: rows at or above the median density are
    never penalised at all (factor exactly 1.0), so it cannot collapse the
    selection into look-alikes from the middle of the cloud.

# same bank `face_cluster` covered 4.7% of the rows and shattered them into 561
# clusters whose biggest held 34% — on a mono-subject bank a semantic/identity
# split is sparse and arbitrary, so balancing on it would spread a selection over

    outdoors, wide shot" instead of a reference picture.

    Mechanically this is ``select_similar`` with the reference vector produced by
    CLIP's TEXT tower rather than read from the image cache: same embeddings, same
    cosine, same deterministic stable-argsort ordering. Ranking costs no GPU and no
    re-scan; only encoding the phrase leaves the Flask process (see
    clip_text_encoder, which caches every phrase on disk).

    It REFINES the current filter rather than replacing it — the candidate pool is
    exactly what the grid is showing, so "wide shot, inside this subfolder, among
    the undecided" composes without a second search grammar.

    TOP-N ONLY — there is deliberately no similarity threshold, and adding one
    would be a mistake rather than a feature. Measured on a real bank (48 images,
    8 unrelated datasets, this exact model): verified-correct top-1 hits scored
    0.177–0.233, while guaranteed-unrelated pairs reached up to 0.197 (median
    0.112). The two distributions OVERLAP — the unrelated ceiling outranks two
    genuinely correct answers. No cut exists that separates "relevant" from
    "unrelated": below ~0.20 it admits false positives, above ~0.18 it discards
    true ones. A threshold control would therefore offer the illusion of a
    boundary that does not exist, so the ranking is the whole product.

    ``push_down`` (or ``-term`` inside the query) names what to push DOWN. It is
    NOT a filter and the UI must never call it one: the excluded phrase is
    encoded like the positive one and SUBTRACTED, weighted, from the score, so
    an image that matches it falls in the ranking instead of disappearing. See
    PUSH_DOWN_WEIGHT_DEFAULT above for the calibration and for the measured case
    where it cannot work at all.

    Returns {'results': [{id, score}], 'image_ids', 'pool', 'filtered', 'unscored',
    'query', 'cached', 'score_range', 'pool_median', 'push_down', 'push_down_weight',
    'push_down_moved', 'push_down_median'}.
      * ``unscored`` — an image with no ✨ Score embedding CANNOT be found by text;
        saying "0 results" without saying that would let the user conclude the
        image is gone.
      * ``pool_median`` — the median cosine over the WHOLE candidate pool for this
        query. It is the empirical "what a typical image here scores" baseline,
        measured per bank and per query, and it is what lets the UI judge whether
        a ranking discriminates at all without hard-coding any constant. On a
        single-subject bank (image-to-image cosine 0.60–0.89) the discriminating
        gap compresses by 30–70%, and that is the app's MAIN use case, not an
        edge case — so the baseline has to be measured, never assumed.
      * ``push_down_median`` — {pool, results}: how strongly a TYPICAL image of
        this bank matches the excluded phrase, against how strongly the returned
        set does. Same reasoning as ``pool_median``, applied to the push-down:
        results well below pool means it worked here, results level with pool
        means it did not, and neither claim needs a universal constant. This is
        the only honest way to report an exclusion whose strength depends
        entirely on how entangled the two phrases are in this corpus.
      * ``push_down_moved`` — how many places in the returned ranking hold a
        different image than they would have without the exclusion. 0 is the
        signal that the push-down changed nothing at all, which the UI has to
        say out loud.

# The bank's folder belongs to the user and is never written to, so "cleaning a
# watermark" here means writing a SEPARATE cleaned blob under the bank's own
# working directory (clean/<image_id>.webp) and pointing the readers at it
# (resolved_image_path). The original therefore stays untouched by construction,
# which is what makes undo trivial and both levels risk-free.
#
# The escalation is deliberate and each level is launched BY HAND:
#   level 1 — ✂ auto-crop: CPU/PIL, invents no pixel. Only touches marks the
#             dataset router calls croppable (inside a border band, and the crop
#             still leaves a usable image). Everything else is left flagged.
#   level 2 — 🧽 inpaint: LaMa (fast, non-generative) or Klein (ComfyUI, handles
#             on-subject marks) over what is STILL flagged. allow_crop=False, so
#             a border mark that level 1 skipped (or that the user never cropped)
#             is repainted rather than cropped — level 2 is the "repaint what's
#             left" lane, not a second router.
# Both reuse the dataset routing/engines verbatim; nothing about the decision

# rejected image is not a deleted one: people un-reject, promote out of the bin,
# and search by caption across the whole bank. Refusing to caption it was a rule

    non-rejected readable image. Reuses the dataset caption engines (JoyCaption /
    Ollama per Settings) through a dataset-free descriptive brick; the captions
    double as the bank's search text and ride along on promotion. Serialized
    against training/vision like the score/watermark passes (503 when the GPU is
    held). BankJobBusy when a job is already live, ValueError on a bad bank/config.

    ``vocabulary`` picks a caption REGISTER (one of face_dataset_service's
    CAPTION_VOCABULARIES: 'explicit' | 'clinical' | 'safe') — the SAME lane the
    dataset caption uses, appended as an instruction. Explicit only spells sexual
    content out when the backend runs an abliterated Ollama model; the choice rides
    per-call (the UI passes it), so a call WITHOUT it is byte-identical to before
    (no instruction appended). Richer captions also mean richer 🔍 search text.

    ``length`` picks the SIZE preset (one of CAPTION_LENGTHS: 'concise' | 'detailed';
    None/'' = standard, nothing appended) — an axis orthogonal to the register, again
    the same lane and the same text as the dataset caption.

    ``backend`` overrides ``captioning.backend`` for THIS run only (one of
    CAPTION_BACKENDS) and ``ollama_model`` overrides ``ollama.vision_model`` for THIS
    run only — the global settings stay the default and are never written. Which model
    writes a caption is not a matter of taste: a captioner that describes what it sees
    in evasive terms produces captions that are about something slightly other than the
    images, and a LoRA trained on them learns to look away too, with nothing in the
    output to reveal it (measured on the video lane, commit "the model that writes the
    captions stops being a decision we made"). Both empty → the global settings, so a
    call without them is byte-identical to before. 'auto' is left alone deliberately:
    it CHAINS JoyCaption then Ollama on what JoyCaption missed, so forcing 'joycaption'
    removes the Ollama half rather than "picking one of two".

    ``statuses`` picks the SCOPE of the run: any combination of CAPTION_SCOPES
    ('keep' | 'pending' | 'reject'). None = the historical non-rejected set,
    byte-identical to before. ['reject'] aims the pass AT THE BIN, which is never a
    default and never part of one — it is reachable only because the caller asked for
    it by name. When ``ids`` are also given the two INTERSECT (the selection is
    narrowed by the scope, never widened).

    ``force`` rewrites captions that already exist — and, since captions carry an
    origin (services/caption_origin.py), it now SPARES the ones a human wrote or
    corrected, the way the embeddings pass spares an asserted face cluster. Rows
    whose origin was never recorded (every row that predates the column) are
    rewritten: their authorship cannot be recovered, and sparing them would make
    this button inert on every bank that exists today. ``include_asserted`` is the
    explicit way OUT of that protection — a separate opt-in, never a default,
    for the person who does want their own captions redone by a better model.
    It means nothing without ``force`` and is ignored there (an unforced pass
    only ever touches rows with no caption at all)."""

# images labelled "body" are the same body in the same pose. The CLIP embeddings
# can, and they are already on disk — so this costs one pass over vectors that
# were computed for other reasons, and nothing new runs.
#
# The statistic is the MEAN PAIRWISE COSINE SIMILARITY of the pool. For L2-normed
# vectors it has a closed form that avoids ever building the n×n matrix:
#
#     sum_{i,j} e_i . e_j  ==  || sum_i e_i ||^2
#
# so the mean over off-diagonal pairs is (||s||^2 - n) / (n^2 - n) — one pass,
# O(n·d), exact, and it does not care how big the bank is. That matters: the
# panel is read-only and opened casually, so it must not become the reason a
# 47k-image bank stalls.
#
# THRESHOLDS ARE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. Taken on the two real banks available
# (117 and 46 775 usable embeddings — deliberately different in size and
# content):
#     whole pool                    0.645   and  0.650

#     a farthest-point sample       0.538   and  0.220   <- varied extreme
# So ~0.65 is what an ordinary bank looks like, a genuinely repetitive selection
# lands around 0.79-0.90, and the statistic is stable across pool size — which is
# why no n-correction is applied. The bands below sit clear of the ordinary
