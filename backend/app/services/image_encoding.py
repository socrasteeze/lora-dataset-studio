"""ONE encoding rule for every operation that rewrites an image the user is EDITING.

The distinction this module exists to hold
------------------------------------------
The app writes image bytes for two very different reasons:

* **Edits of the working image** — mirror, rotate, crop, watermark crop, watermark
  inpainting. The result *replaces* the file the dataset row points at, and that file
  is what `shutil.copy2` hands to the trainer. Whatever is thrown away here is thrown
  away for good, and it lands in the LoRA weights.
* **Throwaway derivatives** — grid thumbnails, the ≤2048 px copy uploaded to a
  generation API. They are regenerated from the working image at will, so lossy is
  free there and staying small is the whole point.

Only the first family belongs here. Thumbnails (`quality=72`) and
`normalize_to_webp` (transport to the engines) are derivatives ON PURPOSE and must
NOT be routed through this module.

The rule
--------
Keep the format the file already has, and encode it under the policy THE CALLING
OPERATION asks for. The policy is a required argument, never a module-wide constant:
mirror and rotate carry a published byte-identity promise, and tuning the crop's
encoder must not be able to break it without the change being visible at the call
site.

Preserving the format is also what keeps the file NAME honest: dataset files are
written with their true extension at import, so rewriting a `.png` as WEBP bytes
would leave a file that lies to everything guessing by extension.

`LOSSLESS` — the only policy in use today; every caller measured its way to it.
* **PNG** — DEFLATE only, native mode kept. Lossless by construction.
* **WEBP** — `lossless=True`. Repeated edits therefore never accumulate damage.
* **JPEG** — has NO lossless mode. Re-encoding always costs something, so the honest
  move is to lose as little as possible rather than pretend: quality 95 with no
  chroma subsampling roughly halves the error of the old q92 WEBP path (measured on
  a real photograph: PSNR 47.6 dB vs 43.0 dB) at ~40% of the size a lossless WEBP of
  the same pixels would take. Converting a user's JPEG to a 2.4x heavier lossless
  file to preserve pixels that were already lossy is a bad trade.
* **BMP** — uncompressed RGB is its native, lossless path. BMP has no dependable
  alpha/ICC round trip in Pillow, so an edit deliberately writes RGB pixels only.

`HIGH_QUALITY` — the documented escape hatch for an operation that decides the size
of `LOSSLESS` is not worth it. It is deliberately NOT the crop's policy, and the
measurement is why (real photograph, 624x624 box rescaled to a 1024 long side; the
error is against the resampled image, so it isolates the ENCODING):

    WEBP q92 (the old crop) 200,756 B  1.00x  max 16   mean 1.367   PSNR 42.93 dB
    WEBP q95             264,644 B   1.32x   max 14   mean 1.084   PSNR 44.84 dB
    WEBP q98             327,570 B   1.63x   max 15   mean 0.924   PSNR 46.06 dB
    WEBP q100 (lossy!)   349,738 B   1.74x   max 16   mean 0.878   PSNR 46.41 dB
    WEBP lossless        921,912 B   4.59x   max  0   mean 0.000   exact

Lossy WEBP has an ERROR FLOOR it cannot pass: libwebp subsamples chroma to 4:2:0 at
every quality (per-channel mean error at q92 — R 1.367, G 1.200, B 1.535: blue is
worst, which is the signature). Paying 1.74x to reach q100 buys 3.5 dB and still
leaves visible drift. And the drift COMPOUNDS across a curation loop — five
successive crops of the same file:

    q92 -> PSNR 44.77 dB (max 21)      q100 -> PSNR 45.09 dB (max 19)
    lossless -> byte-identical to the first crop

More quality does not stop accumulation; only lossless does. On a dataset whose whole
purpose is to become model weights, 4.59x of disk is the cheaper side of that trade.

Why `method=4` and not 6
------------------------
Measured on a 1024x768 photograph, lossless WEBP: `method=6` takes 4.6 s and produces
777,602 bytes; `method=4` takes 0.35 s for 785,268 bytes. 13x the wall time for 1% of
the size, on an interactive click. Not worth it. (`method` is a search-effort knob, so
which one wins on size is content-dependent — on a grainier fixture method=4 came out
2% SMALLER. The time ratio is what decides, not the size.)

What this rule COSTS (measured, same photograph, 624x624 box → 1024 long side)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A cropped WEBP file goes from 201,400 B to 945,746 B (4.70x); the same crop taken from
a PNG source lands at 921,912 B. Roughly 4.6-4.7x either way. That is the price of not
throwing pixels away, and it is stated in the What's-new entry rather than hidden.
