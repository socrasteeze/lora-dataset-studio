"""One decode per clip, every metric out of it — and how per-frame numbers become
a per-clip verdict.

WHY ONE PASS. Decoding is roughly 85 % of this lane's cost, measured on a real
4.5-hour corpus once shot detection moved to the GPU. Motion, exposure, sharpness
and freeze detection are each nearly free once a frame is in hand, so writing them
as four passes would multiply the only expensive part by four. Everything below
consumes ONE list of per-frame readings.

WHY THE AGGREGATION IS NOT UNIFORM, WHICH IS THE SUBTLE PART. The model trains on
EVERY frame, so the useful question is rarely "what is the average?":

  exposure  → MIN. A half-second fade in the middle ruins the sample. An average
              of 0.87 hides a stretch of 0.02 completely.
  sharpness → p90. "Does real sharpness exist in this clip?" Legitimate motion
              blur drags a mean down, so a threshold on a mean rejects exactly the
              clips with the most interesting movement. p90 rather than the p75
              a first draft used, and the arithmetic decides it: a clip that is
              sharp for a fifth of its length is perfectly usable, and p75 sits
              inside the blurred four fifths and calls it soft. p90 finds it,
              while still ignoring a single fluke frame that a max would trust.
  motion    → mean AND a high percentile. "Does anything move at all?" and "is it
              thrashing?" are different questions and cannot share a number.
  freeze    → the SHARE of near-still frames. A frozen second inside a lively shot
              leaves the mean perfectly healthy; only the share reveals it.

WHY RAW SCORES ARE STORED AND VERDICTS ARE NOT. Same philosophy as the image
bank: retuning a threshold then re-sorts the bank with no rescan. It matters more
here than there, because the published thresholds DO NOT TRANSFER — the floor a
public pipeline uses lands at the 7th percentile of this machine's own test bank.
A cut belongs to the bank being worked on, not to a constant.
