"""In-memory per-dataset reference-EDIT job registry + candidate file lifecycle.

Editing the reference photo is a SLOW render (1-3 min). Running it inside the
client's fetch made it die when a mobile tab was backgrounded ("Failed to fetch")
— and the result was lost. So the edit runs server-side: the request returns at
once, a CANDIDATE is filled in, and the client rediscovers it through the dataset
payload — which survives a tab sleep AND a reload.

This registry holds ONE pending edit per dataset:
  {status: running|ready|failed, engine, prompt, candidate_filename, error,
   token, started_at, _touched, _dir, _job_id, _act_token}

It is IN-MEMORY only (like dataset_activity) — a job dies with the process, which
is correct for a transient candidate awaiting Keep. The candidate FILE on disk is
reclaimed by a TTL sweep so a crashed process never leaks it.

ONE LANE ON THIS FORK. Upstream also fills this registry from a blocking API-call
thread; the API engines are removed here (Divergence 1), so every edit is a LOCAL
one — a ComfyUI job enqueued on the app's existing image queue, answered by the
queue worker's completion callback. That is the same waiting path every local
generation already uses, not a second one. `_job_id` is what lets that callback
find its way home (``find_by_job``), and `_act_token` is the dataset-activity
token the callback must close (there is no worker thread left to do it in a
``finally``).

Leak-proofing (what replaces the old client-held "browser GC"):
  * Keep      -> promote + delete the candidate file, clear the entry.
  * Discard   -> delete the candidate file, clear the entry.
  * abandoned -> TTL purge: lazy on get() (deletes the file) + a disk sweep on the
                 next start() (catches a file orphaned by a process crash).
A compare-and-set on ``token`` means a SUPERSEDED worker (a second edit started
before the first returned) never overwrites the newer job — set_ready/set_failed
return False and the stale worker deletes its own candidate instead.

Disk ownership: this module owns the candidate files end to end (create is done by
the service worker, delete lives here), so the lifecycle stays in one place.
