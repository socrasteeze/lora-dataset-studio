"""In-memory per-dataset reference-EDIT job registry + candidate file lifecycle.

Editing the reference photo is a SLOW render (1-3 min). Running it inside the
client's fetch made it die when a mobile tab was backgrounded ("Failed to fetch")
— and the result was lost. So the edit runs server-side: the request returns at
once, a CANDIDATE is filled in, and the client rediscovers it through the dataset
payload — which survives a tab sleep AND a reload.

This registry holds one pending BATCH per dataset. Its ordered engine list owns
one candidate state per engine, while one activity token covers the whole batch.

The registry is in memory (like dataset_activity) — a RUNNING job dies with the
process, which is correct: its provider call died with the thread. The candidate
FILE on disk is reclaimed by a TTL sweep so a crashed process never leaks it.

Surviving a restart
-------------------
A candidate that already LANDED is a different thing from a running job, and
treating the two alike was a real bug: the edit is a PAID call, and the entry
that knew its image existed was the only way to reach it. A restart left the
image on disk, unreachable — the modal came back empty, Keep answered 409, and
the sweep deleted the finished result half an hour later.

So `set_ready` writes a sidecar next to the candidate (`<name>.refedit.json`)
carrying what it takes to re-offer it: batch id, engine, the batch's engine
order, prompt, start time. With no live entry for the dataset, `get(dataset_id,
dsdir)` rebuilds a batch from those sidecars.

Recovery is driven by sidecars and NEVER by filename, because CANDIDATE_MARKER
is in the name of two different kinds of file: the finished result, and the staged
INPUT snapshots a local engine reads (`snapshot_…`, `modalref_…`). Matching on
the marker would hand the user back their own source photo as an edit result.
Only a real result ever gets a sidecar.

What does not come back: a running engine (it returns failed, saying why — a
resurrected spinner would be driven by nothing), the activity token (that
registry is empty in a new process; a stale token would light a badge nothing
could turn off), and anything past the TTL, measured on the image's own mtime so
recovery, the lazy purge and the disk sweep can never disagree.

ONE LANE ON THIS FORK. Upstream also fills this registry from a blocking API-call
thread; the API engines are removed here (Divergence 1), so every edit is a LOCAL
one — a ComfyUI job enqueued on the app's existing image queue, answered by the
queue worker's completion callback. That is the same waiting path every local
generation already uses, not a second one. `_job_id` is what lets that callback
find its way home (``find_by_job``), and `_act_token` is the dataset-activity
token the callback must close (there is no worker thread left to do it in a
``finally``).

Leak-proofing (what replaces the old client-held "browser GC"):
  * Keep      -> promote one named candidate, delete every sibling, clear.
  * Discard   -> delete every candidate file and clear the batch.
  * abandoned -> TTL purge: lazy on get() (deletes the file) + a disk sweep on the
                 next start() (catches a file orphaned by a process crash).
A compare-and-set on ``token`` means a SUPERSEDED worker (a second edit started
before the first returned) never overwrites the newer job — set_ready/set_failed
return False and the stale worker deletes its own candidate instead.

Disk ownership: this module owns the candidate files end to end (create is done by
the service worker, delete lives here), so the lifecycle stays in one place.
