"""Honest diagnosis of a LOCAL training run that died.

Two pure helpers — no GPU, no ai-toolkit, no filesystem — so both are testable
with plain strings and simulated probe payloads:

* `extract_error_excerpt` picks the part of a training log that EXPLAINS the
  failure (the last traceback, else the last real error line) instead of the
  raw tail. ai-toolkit's very first lines are usually a harmless
  `FutureWarning` from huggingface_hub, and a run that dies before writing
  anything else made the panel show that warning in red as if it were the
  cause. When nothing in the log looks like an error we say so, in plain
  words, instead of dressing the last lines up as one.

* `torch_arch_verdict` turns a torch/GPU probe into a verdict on whether the
  installed PyTorch actually ships kernels for this GPU. The RTX 50 trap:
  Blackwell is compute capability 12.0 (`sm_120`) while stable PyTorch wheels
  only carry kernels up to `sm_90`. `torch.cuda.is_available()` still returns
  True, the GPU is named correctly, buckets and datasets are built — then the
  FIRST real kernel launch dies with "no kernel image is available for
  execution on the device" and ai-toolkit exits 1 with nothing useful said.

* `interpreter_verdict` (+ `missing_module_in_log`, `is_windows_store_python`)
  answers the question the panel never used to answer: WHICH Python was used.
  An interpreter that exists and runs but has no torch is the worst shape of
  all — everything looks configured, and the failure blames something else.

Both return "I don't know" (kind `none` / `None`) rather than guessing: the
absence of information is never reported as a diagnosis.

Surfaced by the failure block in TrainingPanel and by the training preflight.
The Blackwell trap was reported by wannadecryptor (Discord, RTX 5070).
