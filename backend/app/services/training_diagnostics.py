"""Honest diagnosis of a LOCAL training run that died.

Two pure helpers — no GPU, no ai-toolkit, no filesystem — so both are testable
with plain strings and simulated probe payloads:

* `extract_error_excerpt` picks the part of a training log that EXPLAINS the
  failure (the last traceback, else the last real error line) instead of the
  raw tail. ai-toolkit's very first lines are usually a harmless
  `FutureWarning` from huggingface_hub, and a run that dies before writing
  anything else made the panel show that warning in red as if it were the
  cause. When nothing in the log looks like an error we say so, in plain
  words, instead of dressing the last lines up as one.

* `torch_arch_verdict` turns a torch/GPU probe into a verdict on whether the
  installed PyTorch actually ships kernels for this GPU. The RTX 50 trap:
  Blackwell is compute capability 12.0 (`sm_120`) while stable PyTorch wheels
  only carry kernels up to `sm_90`. `torch.cuda.is_available()` still returns
  True, the GPU is named correctly, buckets and datasets are built — then the
  FIRST real kernel launch dies with "no kernel image is available for
  execution on the device" and ai-toolkit exits 1 with nothing useful said.

* `torch_cuda_verdict` answers the question BEFORE that one: will ai-toolkit
  train on the GPU at all? It takes its device from Hugging Face Accelerate
  (`self.device = str(self.accelerator.device)` in BaseSDTrainProcess since
  2025-01-25, before Krea 2 existed), never from the job config, and Accelerate
  resolves to the CPU without a word when torch cannot see a card — a CPU-only
  wheel (a plain `pip install torch` on Windows), a CUDA build newer than the
  NVIDIA driver, a card hidden by CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES — or when its own
  switches point there (ACCELERATE_USE_CPU, ACCELERATE_TORCH_DEVICE), which the
  probe reads back directly. The run then "works": the card stays empty, RAM
  fills up, the ETA reads in the hundreds of hours. Nothing fails, which is
  the whole problem.

* `interpreter_verdict` (+ `missing_module_in_log`, `is_windows_store_python`)
  answers the question the panel never used to answer: WHICH Python was used.
  An interpreter that exists and runs but has no torch is the worst shape of
  all — everything looks configured, and the failure blames something else.

All of them return "I don't know" (kind `none` / `None`) rather than guessing:
the absence of information is never reported as a diagnosis.

Surfaced by the failure block in TrainingPanel, by the training preflight, by
the launch gate and by the Settings ▸ Local tools Test button. The Blackwell
trap was reported by wannadecryptor (Discord, RTX 5070); the silent-CPU trap by
acontentsheltie (Discord, RTX 3090).
