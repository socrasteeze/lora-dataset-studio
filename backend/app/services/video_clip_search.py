"""🔎 Type a word, get the scenes — CLIP embeddings per shot, and the search over them.

A bank of rushes is a haystack whose needles have no names. Metrics tell you which
shots are sharp and which move; they cannot tell you which one has the red car in
it. This module is the answer to that question, and it is the one the user asked
for out loud: type "a woman walking on a beach" and get the shots back, ranked.

WHY SEVERAL FRAMES PER SHOT, AND WHY THE MAX
A shot is a SPAN, and a thumbnail is one instant of it. Embed only the ambassador
frame and a car that drives into view in the last second is invisible — not
mis-ranked, invisible, with no error to see and no way for the user to tell the
scene from one that genuinely is not there. So each shot contributes three frames
(one after its start, its ambassador — the sharpest frame the metrics scan
measured, ``sharpest_frame_s`` — and one before its end), and a shot's score for
a query is the MAX over them. The max, not the mean: a mean asks "is this shot
ABOUT the query", and what the user is asking is "does the query APPEAR in this
shot". Averaging in the two seconds where it does not appear is exactly how the
right answer loses to a blander one.

WHY THE FRAMES ARE DECODED HERE AND EMBEDDED THERE
PyAV is in the Flask venv; torch/open_clip are not (see scoring_python.py). So the
decode happens in-process — the same seam shape as ``video_metrics_scan`` — the
frames land as JPEGs in a scratch folder, and a warm CLIP worker in the ✨ Score
interpreter turns them into vectors (``clip_image_encoder``). The scratch JPEGs are
deleted as soon as their vectors exist: they are an IPC detail, not an asset, and
keeping three per clip would quietly cost hundreds of MB on a real bank.

The frames are extracted at EMBED_LONG_SIDE, NOT at the metrics scan's 160 px.
That pass reduces hard on purpose (a Laplacian at 1080p costs more than the
decode), but CLIP ViT-L/14 sees 224×224 and feeding it an upscaled 160 px frame
would degrade every vector in the bank to save nothing — the decode, not the
resize, is the cost. Two different passes, two different sizes, on purpose.

WHY THE VECTORS ARE A FILE AND THE STATE IS A COLUMN
Three 768-float vectors per clip is a matrix, not a set of rows: every reader
wants all of it at once (a search is one matrix multiply) and no reader wants one
clip's. So the vectors are an .npz next to the bank's thumbnails, exactly like the
image lane's ✨ Score cache, and ``VideoClip.embed_state`` carries only what the
resume contract and the counters need — both answerable without numpy.

RESUME. The flush order is: vectors to disk FIRST, states to the database second.
Killed in between, a clip has a vector nobody claims: the next run re-embeds it
and overwrites it with an identical one. The reverse order would leave a clip
marked embedded with no vector — findable by nothing, forever, with no way to
notice. One of those two failures is free and the other is permanent.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
No similarity threshold, and no default one to tune. Measured on this exact
checkpoint, correct top-1 hits and guaranteed-unrelated pairs OVERLAP (0.177-0.233
against a 0.197 unrelated ceiling): no cut separates them, so a threshold control
would be a knob over a boundary that does not exist. The ranking is the product,
and ``pool_median`` — what a typical shot of THIS bank scores for THIS phrase —
is the only honest yardstick, because it is measured rather than assumed.
