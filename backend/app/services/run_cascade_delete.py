"""Delete a run AND everything it produced — the explicit, opt-in cascade.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODE, NOT THE NEW DEFAULT
------------------------------------------------
``cloud_training.delete_run_record`` removes a GONE run: a row the graph already
badges as having nothing on disk. It refuses (``has_saves``) a run whose
checkpoints still exist and it never deletes a generated image. That behaviour is
load-bearing — the ◉ Graph's "Remove this run" and every existing caller lean on
it — so it is left EXACTLY as it was. Changing its meaning under those callers
would turn a tidy-up button into a file shredder without anyone touching them.

The cascade is therefore its own function, reached only through an explicit
``?cascade=1`` on the delete route. What it takes:

  • every checkpoint this run produced, to the recycle bin / app trash (local
    run-dir saves through ``lora_training.delete_checkpoint``, cloud staging
    saves + the harvested final through ``trash.send_to_trash``);
  • every generated image linked to the run, through
    ``cloud_training.delete_checkpoint_images`` — the SAME function the gallery's
    own Delete uses, so the recycle-bin promise, the shared-file rule and the
    "a generating row is never cancelled" rule are kept in one place;
  • the run row and its notes / preview links / canvas position, through the same
    row sweep the conservative delete uses.

What it deliberately does NOT take, and why:

  • **Runs that continued from it** — detached (``parent_record_id`` → NULL), never
    deleted. They are real work with their own checkpoints; the parent's removal
    re-roots them and nothing else.
  • **LoRAs deployed into ComfyUI** — kept. A deployed copy lives in the ComfyUI
    models folder, outside the run, and the user's saved workflows reference it by
    filename. Deleting a run is a lineage decision; silently breaking generation
    graphs that have nothing to do with lineage is not what the click asked for.
    The confirmation counts them and points at Checkpoints & LoRAs → Undeploy.
  • **Images the user rated good** — kept, and unlinked like the conservative path.
    A thumbs-up is the one explicit "I am keeping this" signal the app records;
    destroying a picture the user marked as a keeper is worse than leaving an
    orphan behind. The confirmation says how many survive.

Refusals, never a best-effort mess:
  • a run whose dataset is training RIGHT NOW → ``training`` (409). Deleting
    files ai-toolkit is about to rewrite invites corruption — the same guard
    ``delete_checkpoint`` already enforces, checked up front so the cascade does
    not half-run;
  • a checkpoint that could not be moved → ``partial`` (409): the files that DID
    go are reported, the run row STAYS. A run whose record vanished while its
    weights sat on disk would be unreachable from the graph forever.

Every count returned is what actually happened, so a partial success can never be
displayed as a clean one."""
