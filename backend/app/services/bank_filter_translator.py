"""Turn a sentence like "I want an amateur dataset" into the bank's OWN filter.

The model does not look at a single image and does not choose which images you
get. It moves your controls, and the grid's existing counters then say — measured,
without the model — how many images that lands on. That split is the whole design:
a wrong translation costs you one glance at chips you can edit, not a silent
selection of 3 000 pictures you have to trust.

WHY A TRANSLATOR AND NOT A JUDGE. Asking a vision model to rate 25 000 images is
hours of GPU behind the exclusive fence, and it would be WORSE: the aesthetic head
is trained for exactly that judgement and already ran. Everything a request like
"amateur" needs — medium, the aesthetic flag, resolution tiers, noise — is measured
and indexed. The only thing missing is the sentence-to-facet step, which is small,
cheap, and verifiable.

THE VOCABULARY IS IMPORTED, NEVER RETYPED. Every allowed value comes from
`image_bank_service` at call time. A copied list is a list that drifts, and a
drifted list here would let the model emit a facet value the grid silently ignores
— the user would read a confident summary over an unchanged grid.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO, on purpose:

* No negated CLIP phrase. MEASURED on this app's own encoder: "a woman without a
  bikini" returns 60% bikinis against a 10.1% baseline, and "an abstract 3d shape
  without blue" ranked blue images 1st-4th. Negation does not weaken a concept, it
  SUMMONS it. A request to exclude something becomes the word-exclude box (which
  guarantees absence) or is reported as unsupported — never a "without" sent to
  CLIP.
* No invented axis. A request that needs what the picture CONTAINS ("women
  outdoors") has nothing to land on while captions cover ~1% of a bank and framing
  ~0.03%; saying so is the useful answer. A plausible filter over axes that cannot
  express the request would return 3 000 convincing, unrelated images.
* No style facet while the style partition is degenerate. Single-link clustering
  collapses (measured: one group holding 24 928 of 24 931 images), so filtering by
  it would look like a choice and be none.
