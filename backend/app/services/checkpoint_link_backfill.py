"""Attach the test images ALREADY on disk to the checkpoint that produced them.

From now on every launch writes ``lora_test_image.record_id`` / ``.step`` itself
(Test Studio, LoRA Canvas, comparison grid). This pass is what gives the same
link to everything generated before the columns existed, so the canvas gallery
opens on a real history instead of on an empty strip.

Two sources of evidence, in that order — and NOTHING else:

1. **The preview pointer.** ``checkpoint_preview`` already records
   ``(record_id, step) → lora_test_image_id`` for every image the Lab generated
   inline. That is not a heuristic, it is the link written at the time. One
   set-based UPDATE.

2. **The run tag baked into the deployed LoRA's name.** Deploying a checkpoint
   stamps the name with ``_rl<record id>`` (local) or ``_rc<cloud run id>``
   (cloud) — ``lora_training.parse_deployed_run`` reads it back — and the step is
   zero-padded in the middle of the same name
   (``cloud_training._step_of_testable``). A row whose ``checkpoint`` carries
   both is attributable exactly.

Everything else is LEFT UNLINKED. A name with no run tag (imported before
tagging existed), a step-less final save (its step is only knowable by scanning
the run folder), a tag pointing at a run that no longer exists, a cloud tag
matching two records — all skipped. Those images stay invisible under the nodes
and the UI says how many there are (``unlinked_count``). Guessing would put a
stranger's image under someone's checkpoint, which is worse than an honest gap.

Same discipline as ``lineage_backfill`` / ``framing_backfill``: version marker in
``SystemState``, idempotent, COUNT before UPDATE, set-based writes, and a failure
that never keeps the app from starting.
