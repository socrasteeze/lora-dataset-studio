"""Provenance registry for training runs — "which VERSION of the dataset
produced this checkpoint?"

Every training LAUNCH (local or cloud) records a TrainingRunRecord carrying a
FINGERPRINT of the dataset's training-relevant state (kept images + captions +
per-file size/mtime + trigger + kind). A fingerprint never seen for this
(dataset, family) allocates the next human version (v1, v2, ...); re-running an
unchanged dataset keeps its version. The stored MANIFEST lets the UI say WHAT
changed since a version ("+2 images, 3 captions edited"), not just that it did.

Registration is best-effort by design: a registry failure must never block a
training launch (the feature is provenance, not a gate)."""
