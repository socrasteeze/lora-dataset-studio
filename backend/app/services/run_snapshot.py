"""The full FREEZE of a training launch — everything that defines the run, kept
so that comparing two runs tells the truth.

`TrainingRunRecord.manifest` already froze WHICH images and WHETHER their caption
changed (an id + two short hashes per image). That is enough to say "3 captions
edited" and nothing more: the diff could never show WHAT they said, which is
precisely where a comparison of two trainings is decided. And "same images" was
asserted from a `size:mtime` proxy, so a re-crop, a "Reset to auto", a rembg mask
or a scrubbed watermark could change the pixels while the manifest shrugged.

This module builds the companion blob (`TrainingRunRecord.snapshot`, JSON):

    {"v": 1,
     "captions": {"<image_id>": ["long caption", "short caption"|null]},
     "images":   {"<image_id>": {"c": <content sha1>, "e": engine,
                                 "s": source, "f": framing}},
     "env":      {...run_environment.capture()...},
     "dataset":  {"name", "kind", "subject_type", "fidelity",
                  "reference": {"filename", "c": <content sha1>}}}

Design constraints, all of them load-bearing:

* **The launch must not slow down.** Content hashes are CACHED on the image row
  (`content_sig` + the `size:mtime` they were computed for): the first launch
  after the upgrade pays the read, every later launch pays one `stat` per image.
  `build()` does all of its file I/O OUTSIDE any transaction and returns the
  cache updates for the caller to flush in the SINGLE short commit that also
  writes the record — the launch path already lost three cloud runs to
  `database is locked`, it is not getting a second writer.

* **The fingerprint is untouched.** The content hash lives here, NOT in the
  manifest, because the manifest feeds `fingerprint_of()` and every dataset
  version in every existing database is keyed on it. Changing what goes into the
  fingerprint would bump every dataset to a new version on its next launch and
  announce a change that never happened.

* **Absence is a fact, not a failure.** A run recorded before this existed has
  `snapshot = NULL`; the diff says so. A probe that fails leaves its key out.
  Nothing here may ever raise into a launch.
