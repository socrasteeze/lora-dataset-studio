"""Which table does a cloud run's `dataset_id` point into?

`cloud_training_run.dataset_id` has always meant a `face_dataset.id`. Once a run
can instead point at a `video_dataset.id`, two tables share ONE integer space:
face dataset #3 and video dataset #3 both exist, both resolve, and every consumer
that looks the id up without asking which table quietly serves the wrong row. No
exception is raised anywhere along that path — the run simply appears under
another dataset's name, and its checkpoints under another dataset's routes.

This module is the single place that answers the question, so that no caller has
to remember to ask it twice the same way.

WHY THE COLUMN IS CALLED `dataset_table` AND NOT `dataset_kind`
---------------------------------------------------------------
`dataset_kind` is already taken, twice, with a DIFFERENT vocabulary:
`face_dataset.kind` and `training_preset.dataset_kind` both hold
'character' / 'style' / 'concept'. A third column of the same name holding
'face' / 'video' would make a grep for `dataset_kind` return two unrelated
meanings, and a reader who assumed the familiar one would be wrong in a way that
compiles. `dataset_table` says exactly what it holds — the name of the table
`dataset_id` points into — and its values ARE those table names, so there is
nothing to look up.

The values are stored in user databases. Per the repo's rule on stored
identifiers, renaming either one later needs an alias path.
