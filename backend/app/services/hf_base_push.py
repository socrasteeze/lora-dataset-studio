"""One-time push of a CUSTOM training base to a PRIVATE Hugging Face model repo.

Cloud pods train from Hugging Face repo ids: the official bases (and the gated
Klein ones) are downloaded pod-side with the user's HF_TOKEN. This service
extends that exact mechanism to CUSTOM weights: the user pushes their base ONCE
to a private repo on their own account, and every cloud launch afterwards points
``model.name_or_path`` at that repo — the pod downloads it at datacenter speed,
nothing is re-uploaded from the home uplink, and the pod is never billed while
the (one-time) upload runs.

Scope — the three cloud families only:
  * krea:       single ``.safetensors`` file (absolute local path);
  * flux2klein: single ``.safetensors`` file — the pod's loader HARDCODES the
                filename per size (``flux-2-klein-base-4b/9b.safetensors``), so
                the file is stored under the variant's exact expected name;
  * zimage:     the CONVERTED diffusers folder (``converted_dir``: transformer/
                config.json + weights) — uploaded as a folder; the pod loads it
                via ``from_pretrained(repo_id, subfolder='transformer')``.
SDXL and FLUX.1 stay local-only (out of scope, unchanged refusals).

Naming: ``lds-base-<combo-hash>`` where the hash is the SAME
``lora_training._custom_combo_hash`` that already isolates custom run folders —
one repo per distinct custom base, shared across datasets (the cache key).
Privacy is NON-NEGOTIABLE: the repo is created ``private=True``, there is no
toggle, and a pre-existing repo found public is flipped back to private before
any upload (refusing outright if that fails).

Reuses hf_publish's bricks: HfApi construction, the write-scope whoami
preflight (read-only tokens refused BEFORE any upload, with the actionable
message), HTTP status extraction, and the background-job + poll-status shape.
