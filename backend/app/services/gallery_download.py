"""⬇ Getting generated images OFF the board — one at a time, or a gallery as ZIP.

WHY THE FILE NAME IS THE FEATURE
--------------------------------
The ◉ LoRA Canvas is the only screen in the app that knows an image's whole
ancestry: which dataset, which run, which checkpoint, which seed.  Until now
that knowledge could only be *looked at*.  The moment a picture leaves for the
Downloads folder it keeps whatever ComfyUI happened to call it —
``out_00042_.png`` — and a week later nobody can say which checkpoint produced
it.  Two files from two checkpoints of the same run are then indistinguishable,
which defeats the only reason the board exists.

A settings sidecar (a ``.txt``/``.json`` beside each image) was deliberately
ruled out.  So **the file name is the sole carrier of the lineage**, and it has
to earn that:

    ``<dataset>_run<id>_step<NNNNNN>_seed<seed>_<imageId>.<ext>``
    e.g. ``Nova-Style_run42_step002500_seed208607443_1187.png``

  * **zero-padded step** — the whole point.  Sorted as text, ``2500`` comes
    before ``500``; ``002500`` does not.  Six digits covers every realistic
    schedule, and a step above that simply stops being padded rather than being
    truncated into a lie.
  * **``stepunknown`` for a step-less save** — ``u`` sorts after the digits, so
    the group the run gallery puts last lands last here too, for free.
  * **the image id last** — the collision breaker.  Two renders of the same
    checkpoint with the same seed are a normal thing (different sampler, another
    day); the row id is unique by construction, so the name is too.
  * **the seed segment disappears when there is no seed** rather than becoming
    ``seed None``.
  * portable: NTFS's forbidden set ``<>:"/\\|?*`` never survives the slug,
    neither do control bytes, trailing dots/spaces or the DOS device names, and
    the whole thing is bounded well under the 255-byte component limit that
    Windows, ext4 and APFS all share.

WHY NOT DEFLATE
---------------
Every one of these files is a PNG or a JPEG — already compressed.  Deflating
them again buys a percent or two for a lot of CPU on a machine that is usually
also training something, so the archive is STORED.  A gallery ZIP is then
roughly a disk copy.

CAPS ARE ANNOUNCED, NEVER SILENT
--------------------------------
``gallery_download_plan`` is the cheap half — rows and ``os.path.exists`` only,
no bytes moved — so the UI can say *before* the click how many images it is
about to get, how many files have vanished, and whether the cap cut the list.
A ZIP that quietly holds 500 of 812 images is exactly the kind of half-truth
this project removes everywhere else.
