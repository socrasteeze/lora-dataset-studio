"""↩ Undo for the bank's bulk decisions — one step back, per bank.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Marking hundreds of images in one gesture (✓/✕ over a whole filter, auto-reject
at a threshold, collapsing every duplicate group) is the bank's biggest lever and
was its only irreversible-feeling one. A mis-set threshold used to cost a manual
re-triage of everything it caught.

WHAT IT REMEMBERS — and what it deliberately does not
-----------------------------------------------------
Only the STATUS DIMENSION: ``(status, reject_reason)`` per row, the two columns
those actions write. That is exactly the set of bulk actions that are reversible
*cleanly*, and the honesty rule is that we offer undo for nothing else:

* 🗑 Delete rejected sends source files to the OS trash (which we cannot pull
  back programmatically) and drops the rows with all their analysis — an
  "Undo" there would restore, at best, half of half. It CLEARS this registry
  instead, because the rows a pending snapshot points at are the ones it just
  deleted.
* ⬆ Promote copies through the dataset import path; un-promoting would mean
  deleting images in someone else's dataset.
* 🔄 Rotate lives on another column and already has a natural inverse (turn the
  other way), which the toast says.

DEPTH IS ONE, ON PURPOSE
------------------------
Not a shortcut — the only depth at which "every row goes back to exactly what it
was" stays checkable. A deeper stack would have to reason about whether older
states still hold after a re-scan dropped rows or a pipeline re-flagged them, and
would invite unwinding *through* a pipeline whose other effects do not unwind.
Zero → one is the whole value.

IN MEMORY, LIKE THE JOB REGISTRY
--------------------------------
Same declared lifetime as ``bank_jobs`` and ``dataset_activity``: the snapshot
lives in the SERVER, so it survives a page reload, a tab switch and a second tab
— which a React-state undo does not — and dies with the process. A restart is a
defensible session boundary for "undo my last click", and it costs no schema
migration on the databases users already have. The UI states the boundary rather
than implying permanence.

A snapshot entry is ``{image_id: {'before': (status, reason),
'after': (status, reason)}}``. Keeping ``after`` is what lets the restore tell
"nobody touched this since" from "someone did" — the latter is skipped and
NAMED, never clobbered.

    Mutators call :meth:`note` right before writing; rows whose value would not

    genuinely flipped rather than the size of the selection.

    One snapshot can span several mutators (the pipeline's auto-reject step is
    ``apply_flags`` followed by a duplicate resolution): the earliest ``before``
    wins and the latest ``after`` is kept, so the pair still describes the whole
