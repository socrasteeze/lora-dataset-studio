"""Checkpoints & LoRAs of a VIDEO dataset — both lanes in one list, and every
verb the image workspace's Checkpoints section has, at the unit of the STEP.

WHY THE STEP AND NOT THE FILE. A Wan 2.2 checkpoint is two files at one step
(`_high_noise` / `_low_noise`), and every operation that takes a file where it
should take a step gets it wrong without raising: a deploy that puts one expert
in ComfyUI, a delete that leaves the other half on disk, a "continue" that seeds
half a LoRA. So the list is grouped by step (`cloud_video_training.harvested_steps`
already does this for a cloud run; `group_saves_by_step` is that grouping made
shareable with the local folder), and deploy / delete take a step and act on
all of its files. Download stays per file, because two files side by side is
what ai-toolkit wrote and what every loader downstream expects.

WHY ONE LIST FOR TWO LANES. The image workspace shows local saves and cloud
runs' saves in the same section, with the same verbs. The video lane had the
cloud half only, rendered at the tail of the training block with a download link
per file and nothing else — a user who learned "📦 Deploy" on an image dataset
found no such button here (CLAUDE.md's parity rule; maintainer, 2026-09-02).

Deploy goes through the Video Test Studio's own copy (`video_test_studio`):
one folder, one naming, so a LoRA deployed from here is exactly what the
Studio's picker lists as "deployed". Deletes go through the app's trash like the
clips' removal does (`video_bank_service.remove_dataset_clips`) — never
`os.remove` — and a cloud run's per-file delete reuses
`cloud_training.delete_cloud_checkpoint`, which also clears the run's
`checkpoint_local_path` when it pointed at the trashed file.
