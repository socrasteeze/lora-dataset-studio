"""Dataset coverage — what the set never showed.

Sits directly under the composition meter and answers the question the meter
cannot: the meter counts face / bust / body / back against a target, so a set can
be fully green while every single image is the same person, front-on, in one
outfit, under one light. That set trains a LoRA that reproduces exactly that and
generalises to nothing, and nothing in the app said a word about it.

This composes what already exists rather than adding a model:

  * the stored `framing` column (📐 the vision classifier already wrote it) —
    reused here only to say when it is MISSING, since the bar above already
    renders the counts;
  * the captions the caption pass already wrote, scanned by the pure lexicon in
    ``caption_coverage`` for camera view, camera height, lighting, setting,
    outfit and expression.

No new inference, no GPU, no network — one query and pure string work. The whole
point is that it costs nothing to look, so it can be looked at constantly.

Kind-aware: character / concept / style are judged on different axes (see
``caption_coverage.KIND_AXES``), because "only one outfit" is a defect for a
character and meaningless for a style.
