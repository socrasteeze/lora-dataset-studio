"""🎬 Video bank — triage a folder of rushes into a video training set.

The image lane rests on "one row = one file". This one cannot: a two-hour rush is
one file and four hundred training clips. Everything below follows from that.

WHAT A BANK STORES: BOUNDS, NOT MEDIA. A clip is a pair of PTS timestamps until
the moment it is promoted, and the only bytes this module ever writes into the
bank are thumbnails. Encoding at detection time is the obvious design and the
wrong one — cutting 340 shots to keep 128 pays 212 encodes for files nobody asked
for, and it would put media in a container whose contract says it holds decisions.
So `ffmpeg` runs exactly once per KEPT clip, at promotion, and never before.

THE SOURCE FOLDER IS READ-ONLY, LITERALLY. Nothing here opens a file in the user's
rushes folder for writing, ever. Thumbnails go to ``video_banks_root()``, clips go
to ``video_datasets_root()``.

WHY FOUR SEAMS. Probing, shot detection, thumbnailing and encoding each need
something the app cannot assume is installed (PyAV, torch, ffmpeg). They are the
only four places this module touches media, each is one function, and each is
monkeypatched by the tests — so the whole service is testable on an install with
none of the video extras, which is also what CI is.

WHY THE JOB KEY IS NAMESPACED. ``bank_jobs`` keys its registry by bank id, and the
two lanes number their banks independently: image bank 1 and video bank 1 both
exist and are different things. Sharing the raw key makes a video detection pass
refuse a click on an unrelated image bank, with a message naming a pass the user
cannot see. Hence ``job_key()`` — the registry itself is happily reused.
