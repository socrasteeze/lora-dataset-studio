"""📊 Machine load in four numbers — CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM.

What this is FOR: the Canvas shows these while a generation or a training run
is going, so "is the machine actually working, or is it stuck?" is answered by
looking, not by opening Task Manager on the server's desktop.

Three deliberate properties, because a widget that polls forever is a widget
that costs something:

* **Every field is optional.** No NVIDIA card, no `nvidia-smi`, psutil missing
  from a slimmed-down install — the key is simply ABSENT from the payload and
  the widget draws one number less. Never 0, never -1: a zero would read as
  "the GPU is idle" on a machine that has no GPU at all.
* **One cache for every client.** Two browser tabs and a phone on the LAN
  polling every 5 s would fork `nvidia-smi` three times over. The reading is
  shared and at most ~3 s old, under a lock, so N clients cost what one costs.
* **Nothing blocks.** `cpu_percent(interval=None)` measures the window since
  the previous call instead of sleeping through a fresh one; the counter is
  primed at import so the first real request already has a window to report.

The `nvidia-smi` invocation mirrors `capabilities.gpu_vram_gb` (same flags,
same timeout, same CREATE_NO_WINDOW so no console window flashes on the
server's desktop) — that call is cached 10 min for a total that never changes,
which is why the live one cannot simply reuse it.
