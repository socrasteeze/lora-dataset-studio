"""Model-file integrity: is a weights file on disk a REAL, loadable model, or just
a file that happens to have the right name and extension?

Two real incidents motivate this — both passed a plain "the file exists" check,
went green in Setup, then failed cryptically far downstream:

  1. A licence-gated model downloaded from a browser WITHOUT accepting the licence
     (or without an HF token) saves the HTML gate PAGE to ``<name>.safetensors``.
     ComfyUI's UNETLoader then dies at generation time on
     ``Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`` — ``json.loads`` choking on
     ``<!doctype html>…`` — long after the Setup step reported the model present.
  2. A partial download or a broken Stability-Matrix symlink leaves a truncated /
     empty ``<name>.safetensors``. ComfyUI loads garbage and renders SILENTLY
     distorted images with no error anywhere (the kostas212 report).

This validates only the file HEADER, never the multi-GB weight body, so it is
cheap enough (~ms) to run from the probes / preflights that already fire at the
right moments. Layout of the containers we accept:

  * ``.safetensors`` / ``.sft``: an 8-byte little-endian header length ``N``,
    then ``N`` bytes of a JSON object (the tensor index). We read the 8 bytes,
    sanity-check ``N``, confirm the file is at least ``8 + N`` long, and parse the
    JSON object (bounded — a real header is well under a megabyte; anything past
    the parse budget is accepted structurally without reading it whole).
  * ``.gguf``: the 4-byte magic ``GGUF``. ComfyUI-GGUF quantised models are common
    in this community and the app already lists ``.gguf`` alongside safetensors.

Verdicts (see the constants): ``valid`` / ``html_or_text`` (a saved HTML gate
page, a Git-LFS pointer, a JSON error body — the gate case) / ``truncated_or_garbage``
(implausible header length, unparsable header, or a file shorter than its declared
header) / ``too_small`` (structurally valid but far below a plausible floor for its
type — advisory only, never blocking) / ``missing`` (not on disk — the missing-asset
preflights own that case, this validator does not block on it).

The structural verdict is a pure function of the file bytes; a deployed model never
mutates in place. It is cached by ``(abspath, mtime_ns, size)`` so repeated probe /
preflight passes read each header at most once. The ``too_small`` floor is applied
AFTER the cache (a cheap size compare) so the same file can be judged against
different floors without a re-read."""
