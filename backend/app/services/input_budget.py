"""The app side of the shared image input budget.

`image_encoding` holds the guard but may not read config: it is loaded BY PATH
under the dedicated ML interpreter, where the Flask app package does not exist.
So the dependency runs the other way — this module reads the setting and
installs itself into `image_encoding` as a provider, at import. Anything that
imports an app service therefore gets the configured budget; anything that
loads `image_encoding.py` standalone keeps its shipped defaults, which is the
conservative side of the split and is stated in the Guide rather than implied.

The provider is a live read, not a snapshot: saving Settings changes the budget
for the next image, with no restart. That is what keeps import, Bank scan,
thumbnailing, edits, ComfyUI staging and Ollama vision quoting ONE number —
the failure this budget's original comment warned about is an image you can
import but not look at.
