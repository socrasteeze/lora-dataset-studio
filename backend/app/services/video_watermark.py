"""🔖 Which shots carry a watermark — the image lane's detector, one frame per shot.

WHY IT MATTERS HERE MORE THAN IT DOES FOR STILLS. Rushes come off stock sites,
screen recordings and other people's uploads, and a logo that sits in the same
corner of every frame of every clip is not noise to a LoRA — it is the most
consistent thing in the dataset, so it is the first thing the model learns to
draw. The user cannot catch that by scrolling a grid of 90 px thumbnails, which
is exactly the size at which a corner mark disappears.

WHY NOTHING NEW WAS BUILT. The image bank already ships a measured, licence-
checked detector (SigLIP2 ranks, Grounding DINO locates — never `ultralytics`,
which claims AGPL over trained weights and would contaminate this public repo).
It answers in milliseconds with a NUMBER, which is what makes a threshold
possible. This module is the seam that points it at video: extract one frame per
shot, hand the paths over, write the verdicts back.

WHY ONE FRAME, AND WHY THAT ONE. A watermark is a property of the SOURCE, not of
the instant — it is burned into every frame of the file, so a second frame buys
almost nothing and costs a decode per shot on a bank of thousands. The frame
chosen is the AMBASSADOR: the sharpest sanely-exposed frame the metrics pass
already measured. Not the first frame, which is whatever the cut landed on and is
disproportionately a dissolve; not the middle, which is a guess where a
measurement exists.

WHY IT IS EXTRACTED BIG. The embedding pass writes 256 px frames because CLIP
sees 224×224. A watermark is a few dozen pixels in a corner and is simply GONE at
that size — the classifier would then confidently report a clean bank. The two
passes ask the same decode seam for two different sizes on purpose, the same way
the metrics scan asks it for 160 px.

ADVISORY, AND TERNARY. The score lands in metrics_json next to the quality
numbers; the flag is derived at read time against ``watermark_max``, so moving
that cut re-sorts the bank with no rescan. A shot whose frame could not be
decoded, or that the detector could not judge, is 'unreadable' — never a zero,
which would be the app asserting the shot is clean. Nothing is deleted, nothing
is rejected, no triage decision is touched.
