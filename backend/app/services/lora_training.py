    What makes one unusable is its FORMAT, not its bit width, and the two forms
    behave differently (measured — see model_integrity's block comment):

    * a STRUCTURED export (ComfyUI scaled fp8 / comfy_quant, int8 repacks, this
      app's own fp8 twin) ships extra dequantization tensors, and ai-toolkit
      loads a base with ``load_state_dict(..., strict=True)`` — the load itself

      PICKED rather than after the dataset export and (in the cloud lane) after
      a GPU has been rented, for a few kilobytes of header.
    * a BARE cast adds no key of its own; the loader up-casts it to the training
      dtype and nothing in the PACKING stands in the way. Allowed —
      `model_integrity.base_precision_warning` states what it costs instead. It
      can still be refused at load for an unrelated reason (a tensor the
      architecture does not declare); this guard reads the packing only, and its
      wording is careful not to promise otherwise.

    An earlier version of this docstring claimed the trainer "dies deep in the

    * a base model is meaningless outside its family — a Z-Image merge is not a

      the family does. What changes is whether it still suffices. Stashing the

      re-enable quantisation on the way back, which is the same silence in the
      other direction;
    * this is provenance-BLIND on purpose. Someone who unticks "Quantise base
      model" directly on Krea 2 with a 24 GB card is in exactly the same danger
      as someone who unticked it on Anima and switched family. A memory only ever

# The ONLY settings a resume/continue may change. ai-toolkit rebuilds the job
# config from scratch on every launch, so a re-read setting is honored on resume —
# but the LoRA weights being resumed have a fixed shape (rank/alpha/network) and
# the run has a fixed training regime (optimizer, schedule, resolution). Changing
# any of those mid-run either fails to load the checkpoint (shape mismatch) or
# silently trains a different recipe than the one that produced the weights.
# Cadence and preview prompts touch neither: save/sample cadence only decides WHEN
# to snapshot, and sample prompts only affect the preview images. timestep_type is
# the deliberate exception: it changes no weight shape and re-weighting the noise
# levels ON PURPOSE is a documented continuation recipe (train balanced, then
# resume low-noise-leaning to polish fine texture) — the user picks it explicitly
# in the Continue dialog, so it is a stated intent, never a silent drift. SDXL
# ignores it (flowmatch weighting does not apply there) — a harmless no-op.
# lr_factor is the second deliberate exception: it scales the LR of the continuation
# only (½ polish / ⅒ gentle finish — the LR pendant of the low-noise timestep
# recipe), touches no weight shape, and resolves to an explicit `learning_rate`
# via resolve_resume_lr (refused on a Prodigy run, whose LR is self-adaptive).
#
# The memory-saving levers (quantize / quantize_te / low_vram) are deliberately
# NOT in this list, and that is a decision, not an oversight. They ARE harmless to
# a resume — VERIFIED: quantisation is applied to the BASE modules, which are frozen
# (`param.requires_grad = False` + `freeze(orig_module)` in ai-toolkit's
# util/quantize.py), while the resumed checkpoint holds only the LoRA weights,
# whose shape is fixed by `network` (rank/alpha/type) and untouched here. But this
# tuple is the whitelist of what the ▶ Continue DIALOG may send, and the dialog has
# no control for them; the persisted Advanced-options value is already re-read on
# every resume (ai-toolkit rebuilds the job config from scratch), so a user who
# turns quantisation off and hits ▶ Continue already gets it. Listing them would
# add untested surface with no caller.
# `sample_steps`/`sample_guidance` join the list for the same reason as
# `sample_prompts`: they change what a PREVIEW looks like, never the weights, so
# a resume can honour them without mismatching the checkpoint it continues.

# 24 min of CPU before a single byte reached the network — measured, not guessed

# half-hour window in which any app restart killed the run, and what made the

# documents. The re-encode exists for exactly two reasons: bake EXIF orientation
# into the pixels (an upright JPEG must never train sideways) and hand the
# trainer a format it reads. A master that has NO EXIF block at all needs
# neither the baking nor the metadata stripping, so its own bytes go straight
# through.

    ai-toolkit caches ONE embedding per image: TextEmbeddingCachingMixin.cache_text_embeddings

    unloaded SDTrainer takes the `if unload_text_encoder or is_caching_text_embeddings`
    branch, which feeds the model `batch.prompt_embeds` and never looks at the prompt
    strings again. The short caption has, literally, nowhere to go.

    It does not merely go unused — it crashes the run. The caching pass reaches
    load_caption() through get_text_embedding_info_dict() WITHOUT the JSON caption dict,
    so each item is filled from its .txt sidecar (long only) and `raw_caption_short` stays
    None; load_caption() then short-circuits on the real per-batch call ("we already
    loaded it"), `caption_short` is never computed, and the doubled prompt list handed to
    inject_trigger_into_prompt contains None → AttributeError at the first step, after the
    weights download and the whole caching pass. Reported on krea as GitHub issue #22 by
    1Tomber; anima emits the identical pair.

    """EVERY LoRA this app has deployed into ComfyUI — across every dataset and
    every family — so one screen can undeploy a pile of them in one pass.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Undeploying was reachable one pill at a time, buried in a
    node's popover, with no way to see how many were deployed at all. Asked for
    by the maintainer: "a button that lists every deployed LoRA and lets me tick
    the ones to undeploy, to make it faster."

    WHY IT DELEGATES INSTEAD OF SCANNING THE FOLDERS ITSELF, which would be a
    dozen lines shorter: `list_imported_checkpoints` is the one place that knows
    which file in `loras/<family>/` BELONGS TO THIS APP — the `lora_<trigger>`
    boundary plus the cloud runs' own staging prefixes. A plain directory scan
    would also return the LoRA the user downloaded from Civitai and dropped in
    the same folder, and this list feeds a DELETE button. Offering someone their
    own files to remove, in a screen labelled "undeploy what the app deployed",
    is the one failure this must not have.

    Cost: one call per (dataset, family). Each returns [] immediately when the
    family folder does not exist, which is the common case — a machine trains one
    or two families, not six.

    Entries carry their dataset so the caller can address the undeploy route,
    which is dataset-scoped: {dataset_id, dataset_name, family, filename, label}
    plus whatever `list_imported_checkpoints` already stamps (run_id/run_source,

    PLANNED IN FULL, THEN EXECUTED: a half-renamed set is worse than none at all

# -- ComfyUI's resident models, before a LOCAL training takes the card ----------
# ComfyUI keeps the models it last used resident once a render is done (its
# default "smart memory": nothing is unloaded until ComfyUI itself needs the
# room, and a second process asking the driver for VRAM is not that). Every guard in the
# spawn transaction reads LDS's OWN state -- its queue table, its vision flag, its
# Ollama fence -- so a ComfyUI that finished a Klein edit ten minutes ago and still
# holds ~15 GB passed all of them, and a Krea 2 run calibrated for an EMPTY 24 GB
# card started on what was left. On Windows/WDDM that is not an OOM, it is a
# crawl: the driver pages the overflow to system RAM, GPU utilisation drops to a
# few percent and the ETA reads in hundreds of hours (acontentsheltie, Discord
# #help 2026-09-05, RTX 3090). `gpu_exclusive_vision_window` has pulled `/free`
# before every vision pass since July for exactly this reason; the training
# launch never did -- while memory_release.py's docstring already said it did.
#
# Best-effort on purpose, unlike the vision window's fail-closed gate: a training
# does not need ComfyUI at all, so an offline, unreachable or silent ComfyUI is
# logged and the launch goes on. A verdict alone would never tell whether the
# lever mattered, so the card is read before the request and again once the
# child exists and the lock pair is released (the identity writes and the spawn
# sit between the two; ComfyUI unloads from its worker loop within that second)
# and both numbers go to the log.
#
# The import stays INSIDE the function: tests/conftest.py stubs
# `app.utils.comfyui.free_comfyui_vram` by attribute, and a module-level import
# here would bind the real function first and POST /free to a developer's live
# ComfyUI from the unit suite (test_training_launch_frees_comfyui pins this).
# 4 s, not the helper's default 10: a live ComfyUI answers /free at once (the
# unload happens later, on its worker loop); only a dead host ever waits, and it
# would wait under _queue_lock + GPU_ARBITER_LOCK, where Stop also waits.
