"""Turning a pair of timestamps into one training clip on disk.

This module is where every quiet way an export can be wrong is made loud. The
failures it guards against share a shape: ffmpeg exits 0, a file appears, the
dataset looks complete, and the training is subtly poisoned. Several of them are
documented behaviours of the trainers this output is written for:

  * musubi-tuner CRASHES if a clip's caption sidecar is missing — FileNotFoundError
    out of a worker future, with no handler on the path.
  * diffusion-pipe DROPS such a clip instead: skip_empty_caption defaults to true,
    whatever its README says.
  * diffusion-pipe and finetrainers read captions with a bare open(), i.e. the
    host's locale encoding.
  * ai-toolkit never drops a too-short clip and never warns: it clamps frame
    indices and re-expands, so a five-frame clip trains as repeated stills.

WHY WE ALWAYS RE-ENCODE. `-c copy` is not an optimisation we skipped, it is
disqualified. A stream copy can only start on a keyframe, and scraped material
routinely carries a 250-frame GOP (~10 s). Cutting 3-second clips that way makes
the boundary error the size of the clip, throwing away the frame-exact cut the
detector just produced. We would have to re-encode anyway to normalise the frame
rate and the resolution.

WHY WE ASK FOR FRAMES, NOT SECONDS. The target's VAE accepts a frame COUNT — 81,
or 121, or something congruent to 5 modulo 17. `-t 5.0` asks for a duration and
leaves the count to rounding. `-frames:v 81` asks for the thing that matters.
And nothing downstream will correct a mistake here: Wan's "should be 4n+1" is a
CLI help string, not an assert.

x264 on the CPU rather than NVENC, deliberately: a 3-second clip at 848x480
encodes in well under a second, so there is nothing to gain, and the GPU has to
stay free for captioning and training.
