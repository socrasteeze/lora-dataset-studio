"""Reciprocal Rank Fusion over the ranked lists several search engines return.

Bank search can run more than one embedding engine — SigLIP 2 for fine-grained
and multilingual semantics, a LAION CLIP for the unfiltered concepts SigLIP 2
was never trained on. Their results have to be combined, and they cannot be
combined by score: vectors from different CLIP configurations are not
comparable (see ``infer/clip_image_embed_infer.py``), and their cosines sit on
unrelated scales with unrelated temperatures. Averaging or thresholding across
them returns a number that is wrong without looking wrong.

So scores stop at each engine's boundary and only ORDER crosses. RRF scores an
item as ``sum(1 / (K + rank))`` over the engines that ranked it, rank 1-based.

The consequence that shapes the rest of the feature: fusing ONE list returns
that list unchanged, because ``1 / (K + rank)`` is strictly decreasing in rank.
An install that never built a second index gets its single engine's results
verbatim, down this same code path. The degraded case is the general case at
n=1, not a branch to maintain.
