"""Home-grown reader for ComfyUI's ``extra_model_paths.yaml``.

Portable / Stability-Matrix / A1111-shared ComfyUI installs keep their weights
OUTSIDE ``<base>/models`` and register the real locations in an
``extra_model_paths.yaml`` next to ``main.py``. This app hardcoded ``<base>/models``
everywhere, so on those installs it declared models "missing" and re-downloaded
them (PR #5 proved the need). This module resolves models EXACTLY where a running
ComfyUI would, by mirroring ComfyUI's own parser.

Reference semantics (verbatim from comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, read 2026-07):
  * ``utils/extra_config.py::load_extra_path_config`` (the ~34-line parser):
      - ``yaml.safe_load`` the file; ``yaml_dir = dirname(abspath(path))``.
      - each TOP-LEVEL key is a PROFILE with an arbitrary name (``comfyui``,
        ``a111``, ``stability_matrix`` …); iterate all; ``conf is None`` → skip.
      - ``base_path`` (popped, optional): ``expandvars(expanduser(...))``; if it is
        relative it resolves against ``yaml_dir`` (NOT the cwd).
      - ``is_default`` (popped, optional bool): its dirs are inserted at the FRONT
        of the search list (highest priority).
      - every remaining key is a folder TYPE; its value is a string that may be a
        multi-line block (``|``) → ``split("\\n")``, empty lines skipped. Each line:
        with ``base_path`` → ``join(base_path, line)``; else if relative →
        ``abspath(join(yaml_dir, line))``; then ``normpath``.
  * ``folder_paths.py``:
      - ``map_legacy`` = ``{"unet": "diffusion_models", "clip": "text_encoders"}``
        (canonical alias source — we reuse it, no home-grown alias list).
      - default roots: ``diffusion_models``=[models/unet, models/diffusion_models],
        ``text_encoders``=[models/text_encoders, models/clip], ``vae``=[models/vae],
        ``loras``=[models/loras], ``checkpoints``=[models/checkpoints].
      - ``add_model_folder_path(name, path, is_default)``: map_legacy the name,
        then insert(0) if is_default else append (dedup: move-to-front if default).
      - ``recursive_search`` / ``get_filename_list`` return each file's path
        RELATIVE to its root, subfolders included — which is EXACTLY the string a
        loader node (``unet_name`` / ``vae_name`` / ``lora_name`` …) expects. This
        is the real fix for the original ``klein/`` prefix bug: the name carries
        ``klein/`` because the file sits under ``loras/klein/``, not by a magic
        constant.

Extensions: ComfyUI's ``supported_pt_extensions`` = {.ckpt,.pt,.pt2,.bin,.pth,
.safetensors,.pkl,.sft}. We list ``{.safetensors, .sft, .gguf}`` and stay narrow
on the rest so ``picker == probe == resolver``.

``.gguf`` is the exception that is listed but NOT loadable: core ComfyUI has no
``.gguf`` in ``supported_pt_extensions``, so it never scans such a file in ANY
model root, and the shipped graphs emit core ``UNETLoader``, which cannot read one
even when the ComfyUI-GGUF pack is installed (that pack adds a separate
``UnetLoaderGGUF`` node, which nothing here emits). Dropping it would hide a file
users can see on disk and turn a nameable problem into a silent absence; keeping
it is only honest because ``utils.comfyui.unavailable_model_files`` states the
extension as the cause before a job is queued (naniii2352, Discord).

Degradation is total and silent-safe: no base_dir / no yaml / malformed yaml /
PyYAML not importable all resolve to "no extra roots" (logged once), never an
exception. With no yaml the search roots ARE the historical ``<base>/models``
folders, so resolution is byte-for-byte what it was before this module existed.
