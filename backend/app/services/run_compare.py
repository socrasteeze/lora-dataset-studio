"""What ACTUALLY differs between two training runs.

The Lab's compare panel could already put two settings tables side by side. What
it could not do is answer the question the settings never contain: *the dataset
changed — how?* The manifest knew that three captions were edited and refused to
say which; it knew an image was added and could only name its id; and it said
nothing at all about the machine, so a gap caused by a `git pull` in ai-toolkit
was silently charged to the dataset.

This module produces the whole comparison in one payload:

  * **settings** — the recorded recipe of each run, MERGED with the facts that
    live on the record row rather than in the snapshot (steps, base model,
    masked training, dataset version). Those were missing from the panel and are
    among the biggest differences two runs can have.
  * **images** — added / removed / caption-edited / pixel-edited, each as a LIST
    with the caption text on both sides and a picture to look at, including for
    images that have since been deleted (`run_archive`).
  * **environment** — ai-toolkit revision, torch/CUDA, GPU, and the identity of
    the base-model FILE.

Honesty rules, enforced here rather than in the UI:

  * A run recorded before snapshots existed says so (`predates_snapshot`) instead
    of rendering an empty comparison that reads like "nothing changed".
  * When only one side has the true content hash, the pixel comparison falls back
    to the legacy `size:mtime` proxy and is FLAGGED as approximate.
  * Lists are capped; the payload reports how many entries it withheld rather
    than silently truncating.

Older run is always A. Comparing "v2 with v3" and "v3 with v2" must not produce
opposite added/removed lists depending on which card was clicked first.
