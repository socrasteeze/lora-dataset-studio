"""Drive the Qwen3-VL caption worker for the length of ONE pass.

The parent half of ``infer/video_caption_infer.py``, and deliberately the same
shape as ``clip_image_encoder.ImageEncoder``: lazily started, scoped to a
``with`` block, no cache, no idle reaper. A pass owns its worker and gives the
memory back when it ends — cancelled or not. The model is 8.3 GB, so holding it
past the job would be pure loss, and there is no "the user might caption again in
a minute" window to keep it warm for.

Started LAZILY on the first clip: a re-run that finds everything already
captioned — the common case — must not pay a model load to discover it has no
work.
