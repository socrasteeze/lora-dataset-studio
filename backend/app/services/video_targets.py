"""The video training-target catalogue — what each target model demands of a clip.

Every other piece of the video lane derives from this table: the cutter reads the
fps and the frame count, the length selector offers only counts that appear here,
the exporter reads the audio policy. It is pure data plus arithmetic on purpose —
no ffmpeg, no torch, no database — so it stays importable and testable on an
install that has none of the video extras.

WHERE THESE NUMBERS COME FROM, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
--------------------------------------------------------------
Every value was read in the source of the ai-toolkit INSTALLED on this machine.
Not a model card, not the upstream repository on the web. Those three disagree,
and they disagree in BOTH directions:

  * A first pass researched this question on GitHub and concluded ai-toolkit could
    not train LTX. The installed version shipped an LTX trainer all along.
  * The same web sources then reported MiniMax H3 as supported, while the local
    install had no trace of it — that arch only arrived with an update.

So "trainable" here means one thing and nothing else: **this ai-toolkit has an
architecture for it**. The app drives ai-toolkit and no other trainer, so what
some trainer elsewhere supports is not a fact about this app.

`aitk_arch` carries that architecture string, and it is NOT our key: our
`wan22_ti2v5b` is ai-toolkit's `wan22_5b`. Without the field the training config
cannot be written at all.

WHY A CATALOGUE AND NOT CONSTANTS
---------------------------------
The obvious shortcut is to hard-code Wan's 16 fps and its 4n+1 rule. That is
wrong for most of this table: the rule is a property of each model's VAE. LTX
compresses time by 8, so 29 frames is legal for Wan and illegal for LTX. MiniMax
H3 wants frames congruent to 5 modulo 17.

That counter-example is worth choosing carefully, and 29 is not arbitrary: EVERY
length Wan actually offers (17, 25, 33 … 121) happens to satisfy 8n+1 as well. A
rule shared between the two looks correct on every value in the menu and only
breaks on a snapped or hand-entered one — the shape of a bug that survives review.

AND NOTHING DOWNSTREAM WILL CATCH A MISTAKE
-------------------------------------------
The trainer does not validate the frame count on the dataset path. Its VAE encoder
loops `1 + (F-1)//4` and slices; a Python slice never raises, so an off-rule count
silently loses its trailing frames. The proof is in ai-toolkit's own shipped
example configs, which set `num_frames: 40` — not a legal 4n+1 — and therefore
drop three frames from every sample. This module is the only place the rule can
be enforced.
"""

# Frame-count rules. Each maps to "is this count ingestible?", and every profile's
# offered lengths are checked against its own rule by the tests — so correcting a
# rule later forces its lengths to be corrected with it.
#   n4plus1     temporal VAE stride of 4. The 4 is a hard literal in the Wan
#               encoder loop, not a config value, so it cannot drift.
#   n8plus1     temporal VAE stride of 8 (LTX). NOT interchangeable with n4plus1:
#               every 8n+1 count is also 4n+1, so the looser rule would pass
#               illegal lengths through in silence.
#   mod17plus5  MiniMax H3. Not a plain stride — 17 pixel frames per VAE chunk
#               become 5 latents, with 3 trailing latents dropped overall.
#   any         no known constraint — accept anything positive and say nothing.
