"""Drive the CLIP image worker for the length of ONE pass, then give the RAM back.

The parent half of ``infer/clip_image_embed_infer.py``. Deliberately a much
smaller object than ``clip_text_encoder``, and the difference is the point:

* **No persistent cache.** A text query repeats constantly (people refine a
  phrase and re-type favourites), so caching vectors on disk pays forever. A
  frame is embedded exactly once, by the pass that owns it, and its vector is
  stored by the caller — a cache here would hold a copy of a file we already
  wrote and never read it again.
* **No idle reaper.** The worker is scoped to a pass with a context manager. It
  starts when the pass starts and dies when the pass ends, cancelled or not.
  There is no "the user might search again in a minute" window to keep it warm
  for, and the model is ~2.4 GB — holding it past the job would be pure loss.
* **The GPU is asked for.** Text encoding is microseconds of compute behind an
  8 s load, so ``clip_text_encoder`` forces the CPU and never races a training
  run. Embedding thousands of frames is the opposite: ~336 ms/frame on CPU
  against ~15 ms on a card. The caller decides, takes the GPU-exclusive window
  when it decides yes, and gets a child that hid CUDA from itself when it
  decides no.

The interpreter is the ✨ Score one (``bank_scoring.python``) — the very
environment that produced every image embedding this project owns, which is what
makes a video frame and a bank image land in the same space.
