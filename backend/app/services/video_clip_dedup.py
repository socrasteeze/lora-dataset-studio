"""✂ The same shot twice — near-duplicate clips, found in the vectors that exist.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A bank of rushes is full of retakes, and a training set built
from it counts each of them as a separate example. Ten near-identical takes of
one gesture do not teach a model ten things; they teach it one thing ten times as
loudly, which is how a LoRA ends up unable to do anything else. The user cannot
see that by scrolling — the takes are minutes apart in the grid and each looks
fine on its own.

WHY IT COSTS NOTHING. 🔎 Search already embedded three frames of every shot into
a 768-d CLIP space and wrote them to the bank's own .npz. Two shots being
near-identical is a question about vectors that are already on disk, so this pass
DECODES NOTHING and EMBEDS NOTHING: it reads that store, does a few thousand dot
products, and writes verdicts. Re-running it at another threshold is instant, for
the same reason the image lane's stage-2 dedup is instant.

WHY THE MAX OVER FRAME PAIRS, AND WHAT THAT COSTS. A shot is a span, and its
three embedded frames are three different pictures of it — a shot that starts on
a pan and settles shares its settled frames with the retake and nothing else. So
two shots are compared at their CLOSEST pair, which answers "does this bank hold
this moment twice" rather than "are these two shots the same throughout". The
honest cost of that choice: with three frames each, the comparison takes a MAX
over up to nine samples, so it reaches any given cut more easily than a
single-frame comparison would. That inflation is real, it is why the threshold is
exposed rather than baked in, and RAISING it is the remedy when a bank of
similar-looking material over-groups.

WHERE THE THRESHOLD COMES FROM — AND WHAT IS NOT MEASURED HERE.
Measured, in this project, on the IMAGE lane and over the SAME encoder and the
same 768-d space (open_clip ViT-L/14, the ✨ Score cache):

  * 0.96 is the cut the image bank ships for semantic near-duplicates — crops and
    re-compressed variants of one shot — calibrated against the push-down
    experiment's 7 316-image bank (see image_bank_service and
    config.DEFAULTS['bank']['semantic_dup_threshold']);
  * on a single-subject bank, two DIFFERENT photographs of the same person land
    at image-to-image cosine 0.60-0.89 (measured, image_bank_service.rank_similar).
    0.96 therefore sits far above "same subject, same style" and only catches
    pictures that are nearly the same picture.

NOT measured: any video-pair calibration. No corpus of labelled retakes exists in
this project yet, so this default is INHERITED by shared encoder rather than
derived from shots, and it is named as such here for the same reason
video_clip_search.HYBRID_CAPTION_WEIGHT is — presenting an inherited constant as
a measured one is the dishonest half of an otherwise honest feature. A user's own
bank is the calibration: the pass reports its group count, and the threshold is a
setting.

ADVISORY, LIKE EVERY VERDICT IN THIS LANE. Nothing is deleted, nothing is
rejected, no triage decision is touched. Each group keeps a REPRESENTATIVE (the
sharpest member) which carries no flag, and the others carry ``duplicate``. A
pass that flagged every member of a group would be telling the user to drop all
of them, which is the opposite of what it found.

    UNION-FIND, the same shape (and for the same reason) as the image lane's

    one slow pan can chain A~B~C while A~C stays under the cut, and reporting
    that as two overlapping pairs would ask the user to review the same footage
    twice and to keep two of the three.

    Groups of one are not groups and are not returned — a shot with no twin is
    not a finding.

    ONE MATRIX, NOT A PYTHON LOOP OVER PAIRS. The readable form — call
    ``clip_similarity`` for every pair — is O(n²) *interpreted*, and on a
    2 000-shot bank that is two million Python-level numpy calls: tens of
    minutes for arithmetic BLAS does in seconds. So every frame of the bank goes
    into one matrix, the similarities come out in row blocks, and each surviving
    frame pair is attributed back to the shots that own its two frames — the max
    over frame pairs then falls out of the union, since one pair above the cut is
    all it takes. Same shape as the image lane's stage-2 dedup.

    It is still quadratic in MEMORY BANDWIDTH, and that is the honest limit: the
    image lane can block its comparisons by style cluster and this has no such
    partition, so a very large bank pays a full n² matmul. Blocks of 512 rows
    keep the peak allocation flat whatever the bank's size.
