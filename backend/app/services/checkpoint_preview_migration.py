"""Let a checkpoint keep EVERY preview it was ever given, instead of one.

``checkpoint_preview`` shipped with ``UniqueConstraint('record_id', 'step')``:
one row per checkpoint, and regenerating a preview overwrote the pointer. The
image itself stayed on disk, but nothing referenced it any more — a second look
at the same epoch silently erased the first. The LoRA Canvas shows a gallery
under each checkpoint, so the previews have to accumulate.

SQLite cannot DROP a constraint. The table has to be recreated:
``CREATE new / INSERT SELECT / DROP old / RENAME``.

⚠ This is the one step of the whole feature that can lose data WITHOUT AN
ERROR. An ``INSERT SELECT`` that forgets a column, or a WHERE that quietly
matches less than the table holds, destroys rows and returns success. So the
guard here is not "does the table exist afterwards" — it is a ROW COUNT compared
before and after, inside the transaction, with the copy abandoned (and the
original left untouched) the instant the two disagree.

Written for databases nobody here will ever open:
  * idempotent — the constraint is detected through ``PRAGMA index_list``, so a
    database already migrated (or freshly created by ``db.create_all()``, which
    now builds the table without the constraint) is left alone;
  * column-driven — the copied columns are the INTERSECTION of what the old
    table really has and what the model declares, in the model's order, so an
    install that predates a column, or one carrying a column a later build
    dropped, both survive;
  * additive in spirit — nothing but the constraint changes; every row, every
    value, every id is preserved (ids matter: ``lora_test_image_id`` pointers
    are addressed by them);
  * fail-safe — any failure rolls back and leaves the ORIGINAL table in place.
    A canvas gallery that still overwrites its preview is a far better outcome
    than a lost history, and either way the app must still boot.
