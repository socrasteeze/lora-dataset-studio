"""Focused helper to enqueue a SINGLE Flux.2 Klein edit job.

Reused by the face-dataset fan-out. Builds a minimal job from the same
single-edit workflow /generate_edit uses in single mode (WORKFLOW_IMPROVE_SKIN_PATH,
nodes 52=LoadImage, 6=CLIPTextEncode prompt, 77=KSampler seed, 9=SaveImage,
114=UNETLoader Klein). Deliberately a small focused helper rather than a refactor
of the large live generate_edit route.

Node preflight: the shipped 'improve skin.json' is written to use ONLY core +
comfy_extras nodes (the prompt text goes straight into the CLIPTextEncode widget,
and the image-size wiring skips the rgthree 'Any Switch' passthroughs) so a stock
ComfyUI with zero custom-node packs can run it. `klein_missing_nodes()` re-checks
this against the live /object_info as a safety net — if a reverted/edited workflow
or a future change reintroduces a custom node the target ComfyUI lacks, the route
answers one actionable "install pack X, restart ComfyUI" 409 instead of ComfyUI's
raw 400 'missing_node_type'.

Lifted from the parent project's app/services/klein_edit_helper.py for LoRA
Dataset Studio: SRC's module-level COMFYUI_INPUT_DIR/COMFYUI_OUTPUT_DIR constants
become live `cfg.comfyui_dir(...)` calls (config.json changes take effect without
a restart, and an unconfigured ComfyUI raises RuntimeError instead of writing
into a hardcoded path), and the hardcoded consistency-LoRA filename/strength are
now the `klein.consistency_lora` / `klein.consistency_strength` settings.
