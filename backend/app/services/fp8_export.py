"""Local fp8 export: turn a full-precision checkpoint into the smaller
"scaled fp8" file ComfyUI loads natively.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A full-model (dense) run delivers a bf16 Krea 2 transformer of ~26 GB. Nobody
runs inference on that: the community ships fp8/int8 exports of ~10 GB, and
those are what people actually load in ComfyUI. Asking every user to quantize a
26 GB file by hand — after downloading it — is the difference between a run that
produced a model and a run that produced a model they can use.

WHICH FP8 FORMAT, AND WHY THAT ONE
----------------------------------
ComfyUI understands three things when it opens a diffusion checkpoint:

1. **bare fp8 cast** — every weight simply stored as ``float8_e4m3fn`` with no
   scales. ComfyUI loads it (``manual_cast``, or ``fp8_ops`` under
   ``fp8_e4m3fn_fast``), but the fast path multiplies with **scale = 1.0** and
   the values were clamped into ±448 raw: any tensor whose amax exceeds 448
   saturates, any tensor whose amax is tiny loses most of the mantissa range.
   Cheap to produce, worst fidelity.
2. **legacy "scaled fp8"** — per-weight ``<layer>.scale_weight`` (F32 scalar)
   plus ONE top-level marker tensor literally named ``scaled_fp8`` whose *dtype*
   selects the fp8 flavour and whose ``nelement() == 2`` asks for a
   full-precision matmul. Current ComfyUI converts this at load time
   (``comfy/utils.py: convert_old_quants``) into its modern representation;
   older ComfyUI builds read it natively — it *was* the native format.
3. **modern ``comfy_quant`` / ``_quantization_metadata``** — the same numbers,
   expressed as per-layer uint8 config blobs and/or a JSON blob in
   ``__metadata__``. Only recent ComfyUI builds understand it.

This module emits **(2)**. It is numerically identical to (3) — per-tensor F32
scale, ``float8_e4m3fn`` payload, dequantize-then-bf16-matmul — and it is the
only one of the two that loads on BOTH current and older ComfyUI. Choosing (3)
would buy nothing and would silently break anyone who has not updated ComfyUI.
Choosing (1) would be a quality regression we would never see in a test.

The marker is written with ``nelement() == 2``, i.e. "dequantize and do the
matrix multiply in full precision". That matches the community exports already
in use and keeps the file loadable on GPUs with no fp8 tensor cores: this export
exists to halve MEMORY, not to chase fp8 matmul speed.

WHAT GETS QUANTIZED
-------------------
Only large 2-D ``*.weight`` tensors — the attention/MLP projections, which are
where all the bytes are. Norm scales, biases, embeddings and every 1-D tensor
stay bf16: they are a rounding error in size and the first place fp8 error shows
up. ``plan_quantization`` is a pure function of the safetensors HEADER, so the
decision is testable without a single weight byte.

HOW IT RUNS
-----------
Torch and safetensors are imported lazily inside the functions that need them,
so importing the application stays free on a machine without the ML extras.

MEMORY
------
The writer is streaming: the safetensors header is computed up front from the
SOURCE header (every output size is knowable without reading a tensor), then
tensors are read, quantized and written one at a time. Peak resident memory is
one tensor, not one checkpoint — a 26 GB input never needs 26 GB of RAM.
