"""Quantize a checkpoint you ALREADY have, locally, to the fp8 file ComfyUI loads.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
People often already have a full-precision model on disk and need the smaller
format ComfyUI loads for inference. This conversion starts by hand and stays on
this machine.

It is deliberately the SAME implementation — ``fp8_export.export_scaled_fp8``.
There is exactly one definition of "the fp8 file LDS produces", it is unit tested
against real torch, and its output was fed to ComfyUI's own ``convert_old_quants``
to prove the loader accepts it. A second local-only quantizer would have been a
second format nobody would notice diverging.

NOT THE SAME THING AS ai-toolkit's `quantize`
---------------------------------------------
ai-toolkit's ``model.quantize`` (and the app's Advanced ▸ memory settings) quantize
the model IN MEMORY while it loads, so a 24 GB card can train something that would
not otherwise fit. It produces no file and changes nothing on disk — the saved
checkpoint is still full precision. THIS produces a file, and that file is the
artifact you load in ComfyUI. The help text says so, because the two are
constantly confused.

CPU, NOT GPU
------------
Quantization here is an elementwise cast plus one reduction per tensor. Measured
on this machine: ~1.2 GB/s of source through the streaming writer, i.e. under a
minute of compute for a 25.6 GB checkpoint — the run is bound by disk, not by
arithmetic. Putting it on the GPU would buy nothing and would fight ComfyUI and
any training run for VRAM. It stays on the CPU, and takes no GPU lock.
