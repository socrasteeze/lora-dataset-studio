"""Watermark removal on Flux.2 Klein — the V2 sister of watermark_lama.

Why a second method: LaMa (V1) is non-generative and perfect outside the mask, but on
complex texture (skin / fabric / busy background) it smears — the "weird mask sections"
grief — and it can't touch a mark that sits ON the subject (those stay 'review'). Klein
reconstructs texture far better AND makes the on-subject case actionable.

TWO LANES BEHIND ONE ENTRY POINT. `inpaint_watermark_klein` is called both by the 🧽
watermark clean and by the ✦ Repair of a hand-drawn BOX, and since 2026-08-31 they no
longer do the same thing. The caller's free `prompt` is what separates them:

  * NO prompt → the 🧽 WATERMARK CLEAN. The WHOLE photo goes to Klein with the single
    instruction "remove watermark" and comes back entirely re-rendered (below).
  * a prompt → the ✦ BOX REPAIR ("remove the necklace", "fix this hand"). Unchanged:
    crop, prefill, refine, harmonize, paste back ONLY the box, so every pixel outside it
    keeps its ORIGINAL bytes. That byte-exactness is what that lane is sold on in the UI
    ("only the mark changes"), it is the one thing the ✦ Edit lane cannot do, so the
    clean's move to full-frame deliberately did not drag it along.

=== THE CLEAN: whole photo, 4 steps, "remove watermark" (maintainer, 2026-08-31) ======

The recipe: the ENTIRE photo (scaled down to KLEIN_MASK_MAX_MP if it is bigger,
dimensions snapped to KLEIN_LATENT_MULT, never magnified), its DETECTED ZONES ERASED
first (LaMa / cv2 TELEA, KLEIN_MASK_EXPAND_PX of margin, on the full frame) →
klein_inpaint.json, prompt `remove watermark`, steps 4, sampler euler, cfg 1, denoise
1.0, random seed → the render resampled back to the file's ORIGINAL dimensions and
written in place. No crop, no harmonization, no compositing. `boxes` no longer bounds
the repaint — it says "there is a mark HERE, do not hand it back", and everything the
detector missed is still cleaned by the pass itself.

WHAT THAT COSTS AND BUYS, measured on the maintainer's two test images the evening the
decision was taken (bench at 8 steps and the long reconstruction prompt, denoise 1.0):
  * the wall-to-wall TILED watermark — watermark score 0.69 → 0.15, 12 zones → 0,
    visually clean. The crop lane could never win this one: there was no "outside".
  * the 7-LOGO image — 7 zones → 3, one ghost glyph (a logo re-rendered as a moon in the
    sky), and the whole image re-rendered: mean deviation 37/255 on the pixels that
    carried no mark at all.
  * at denoise 0.4 and 0.7, on both images, NOTHING was removed. 1.0 is not a tunable
    here either — for a different reason than the box lane's.

Then re-measured on the SHIPPED recipe (4 steps, `remove watermark`, euler, cfg 1,
denoise 1.0), scored by the SigLIP2 / Grounding-DINO detector rather than by eye —
Klein 9B kv-fp8, same two images, before → after:
  * the wall-to-wall TILED one (1200×800) — watermark score 0.687 → 0.161, zones
    12 → 0, mean deviation 11/255 off the marks. Visually clean.
  * the 7-LOGO one (1488×992 after the cap) — score 0.875 → 0.490, zones 7 → 4. Four
    logos SURVIVE, partly as ghosts, and the whole photo is re-rendered (mean deviation
    29/255 off the marks, sky colours moved).
  * the denoise sweep, again: 0.4 and 0.7 remove nothing at all (7/7 and 9/12 zones
    still standing, score unmoved). 1.0 is required on this graph, not preferred.
THE GHOST-DISC FAILURE MODE, which is WHY the erase step exists. Run NAKED — the whole
photo, no zones erased — Klein does not delete that logo. It REINTERPRETS it: the
disc-with-a-mountain came back as a plausible MOON in the sky, twice in one pass (sky and
horizon), 0.878 → 0.492 with 17/255 of drift off the marks. Three independent runs, three
seeds, one of them straight through `_clean_full_frame` itself. A property of the recipe
on that kind of mark, not bad luck.

WORSE, AND THE REASON THIS IS IN CAPITALS: the detector scores that result at ZERO zones,
because a moon in a sky is not a watermark to a watermark detector. The pass would then
report 'cleaned' on a photo carrying two invented celestial bodies and nothing downstream
would disagree. Any future automatic "did the clean work?" gate must compare against the
SOURCE, never re-run the detector on the output.

WHAT FIXED IT, and what did not:
  * ERASE THE ZONES FIRST (TELEA on the full frame, margin, then the same pass) — no
    moon, no logo, scene faithful, score 0.44, 0 zones, drift 18/255. Shipped.
  * a naked pass with an explicit "do not add any moon…" prompt — no moons either, but
    a washed-out photo at 50/255 of drift. Rejected.
  * lowering the denoise — removes nothing at all (above). Not a lever.
The July doctrine held: a mark still present in the reference is reproduced, so take it
out of the reference. The full-frame pass keeps its whole point — it still clears what
the detector MISSED, which is what wins the tiled case (that one needs no erasing: its
mark has no "outside" to erase toward, and the naked pass already takes it to 0 zones).

An earlier note here claimed "all seven logos gone, no ghost" on a naked run. Two things
were wrong with it, and both are worth remembering: the FIRST measurement of that pair was
taken on a file the maintainer had already cleaned an hour before (same name, 2048×1368
instead of the original's 1365 — a bench input can change under you on a live instance),
and the second was a single seed on a different build read from a downscaled contact
sheet. One seed judged by eye does not establish the absence of anything.

THE SHAPE OF THE RESULT, then, and it is what the UI has to say: erase-then-re-render
clears the zones it was given AND what the detector missed, so it EXCELS on a repeated or
tiled mark — the case a box can never frame. What can still survive is a distinct mark
the detector never found, since nothing erased it from the reference. Look at the output;
↩ Restore original is one click away.

The trade is explicit and is the maintainer's call: the photo is REGENERATED, so the
"every byte outside the mark is original" guarantee does not hold on this lane any more,
and the removal is not guaranteed either — it is a generative pass, not a mask. What it
buys is reach: a mark the detector could not box is now removable at all. ↩ Restore
original (the preserved `.orig` sibling) is what a user who dislikes the re-render falls
back to, and it is untouched.

This REVERSES the July doctrine kept below. That doctrine was not wrong about what it
measured — a masked, box-scoped Klein pass really does reproduce the mark as ghost
glyphs without a prefill — it was answering a different question: how to repaint a BOX.
Asked to clean a photo instead, the same model with a short instruction and the whole
frame in view "works much better" (the maintainer's words, on their own images).

=== THE BOX REPAIR: PREFILL then REFINE (GPU-derived 2026-07-17, unchanged) ===========

This is the lane the crop / prefill / harmonize helpers below still serve:

  1. crop a padded square around the box, upscale it to ~1 MP (the "magnifying glass" so
     a few-pixel mark in a 4K photo is big enough for the model to see);
  2. PREFILL the masked region of that crop — repaint the watermark away with the LaMa
     worker (fallback cv2 TELEA). The result is deliberately soft/blurry; that is fine,
     its ONLY job is to hand Klein a reference with NO watermark left in it;
  3. Klein REFINES the pre-filled crop as a native full-edit (VAEEncode the whole crop →
     ReferenceLatent + KSampler on that latent, denoise 1.0, cfg 1 — NO SetLatentNoiseMask,
     the improve-skin edit pattern). Klein regenerates real texture over the soft prefill;
  4. HARMONIZE the refined crop's tone to the surrounding original at the seam (per zone),
     so the pasted patch has no visible tonal step — see "WHY harmonization" below;
  5. composite the harmonized crop back onto the ORIGINAL in pixel space, pasting ONLY the
     masked region (+ a few-px feather). Every pixel outside that footprint keeps its
     ORIGINAL bytes — that is THE preservation guarantee, and it holds no matter how far
     the model drifts across the (fully re-rendered) crop.

WHY the prefill is mandatory ON THAT LANE (empirical, on a real photo):
  * The masked-inpaint graph (SetLatentNoiseMask + DifferentialDiffusion, denoise 1.0)
    feeds the ORIGINAL crop as the ReferenceLatent. At cfg 1 (guidance-distilled Klein)
    the prompt barely counts against that reference — so the watermark, still visible in
    the reference, is REPRODUCED as ghost glyphs.
  * Pre-filling the reference (watermark gone) kills the ghosts — but if Klein is asked to
    only paint inside the mask it just copies the prefill's blur back. Handing Klein the
    pre-filled crop as a FULL edit lets it regenerate genuine texture over the soft patch,
    which is exactly its improve-details core competency. A Klein pass WITHOUT a prefill is
    proven ineffective, so there is no skip-prefill path — prefill or fail.
  * Read this as being about a BOX-SCOPED pass, which is all it was ever tested on. The
    clean above sends no box at all, has no "outside" to protect and no reference to
    poison, and is measured on its own terms.

WHY harmonization is mandatory (measured on a real photo, GPU 2026-07-17):
  * The full-edit re-renders the ENTIRE crop, so Klein's output drifts globally in tone,
    colour and contrast even OUTSIDE the mask (measured on the seam ring of a real 1024²
    crop: luma -8.6, per-channel means R -8.8 / G -7.7 / B -12.6, contrast std ratio ~1.3).
  * The composite pastes ONLY the masked rectangle, so that drift lands as a hard step at
    the paste boundary — the "visible square" grief, worst on soft flats (skin, walls,
    knit) where a constant offset reads as a clean rectangle. The feather smooths the alpha
    edge but CANNOT remove a tonal offset.
  * Fix: on the "seam ring" — the band of pixels just OUTSIDE the mask, where the original
    is the ground truth Klein was meant to reproduce — measure the per-channel mean/std of
    original vs fill; that difference IS the drift. Apply the inverse per-channel affine
    (gain = orig_std/fill_std, bias to match means) to the whole patch so it lines up with
    the neighbourhood. It is a linear transform, so it PRESERVES Klein's reconstructed
    texture; it only re-seats its tone. Done PER ZONE (each mark harmonized against its own
    local ring) so a multi-mark crop spanning different lighting corrects each seam locally.
    The correction touches the PATCH only — the byte-exact preservation guarantee is intact.

Every lane's ComfyUI round-trip goes through the shared queue_manager (serialized against
training / vision by the worker's own gating); this module then reads the finished render
back — and, on the two box lanes only, composites it locally. Same `(ok, error)` tuple
contract as watermark_lama, on all of them."""

    because Klein is an edit model, not an inpaint-trained checkpoint, and the
    Fill-model conditioning smeared the masked region (GitHub #43); the sampler
    enforces the mask itself, so no inpaint training is needed. Kept as its own

    ONE entry point, TWO lanes, and `prompt` is the switch (see the module docstring):

    * `prompt` empty → the CLEAN. `boxes` are ERASED on the whole photo first (LaMa /
      cv2 TELEA, no crop), then the WHOLE photo is re-rendered by Klein under the
      stored clean instruction (default "remove watermark"; 4 steps, euler, cfg 1,
      denoise 1.0). The zones no longer bound the repaint — they keep Klein from
      re-inventing the mark it would otherwise see in its own reference — and the pass
      still clears marks the detector missed. The result is a new render of the entire
      frame, at the file's own dimensions or at the render's own size depending on
      `clean_output_mode`: nothing is byte-preserved any more, ↩ Restore original is
      the way back.
    * `prompt` given → the BOX repair: prefill, Klein refine of a padded crop, per-zone
      seam harmonization, and a feathered paste of the `boxes` footprint only. Every
      pixel outside it keeps its ORIGINAL bytes. Unchanged since 2026-07-17.

    Returns the `(ok, error)` tuple contract: `error` is None on success, else
    {'kind', 'detail'} — 'unavailable' when Klein or the prefill engine is not ready,
    'failed' otherwise. The file is overwritten losslessly in its own format; the caller
    is the one that preserved the `.orig` sibling.
    `device` selects the prefill LaMa device on BOTH lanes ('cpu' by default so the
    pending ComfyUI GPU job runs alone; Klein itself always owns the GPU via ComfyUI).
    `klein_model`: see _run_klein_job — the dataset's pick, or None (auto) when the
    caller has no dataset to inherit from.

    `klein_prompt` / `klein_max_mp` / `klein_output` are the CLEAN's three dials
    (config `watermark_clean.*`, resolved by clean_prompt / clean_max_mp /
    clean_output_mode). They are per-run overrides — None everywhere today, because
    both surfaces persist their choice instead of posting it — and they reach the
    clean ONLY. `klein_prompt` is deliberately not `prompt`: that argument is the lane
    switch above, so routing an edited clean instruction into it would silently turn
    every clean into a crop repair.

    `device_id` (DIVERGENCE 6): which machine renders the Klein step ('local'/None =
    this one; a peer or 'api:' backend otherwise). The PREFILL always runs here — only
    the ComfyUI round-trip travels, so the local readiness probe is skipped for a

    """The 🧽 clean (maintainer's 2026-08-31 recipe): ERASE the detected zones on the
    whole photo, hand that whole photo to Klein under "remove watermark", and write the
    render back at the file's own size.

    TWO STEPS, and the first one is not optional when zones are known. Without it, Klein
    does not delete a logo it can see in its own reference — it REINTERPRETS it, and the
    disc-with-a-mountain came back as a moon in the sky (measured, three runs, three
    seeds; the detector scores that 0 zones and never catches it). Erasing the zones
    first — TELEA/LaMa on the FULL frame, `KLEIN_MASK_EXPAND_PX` of margin, no crop and
    no compositing — removed every ghost while the pass kept clearing what the detector
    had MISSED. That is the July "poisoned reference" doctrine holding on this lane too,
    and it is why the clean is not simply the naked recipe.

    `norm` is the validated zone list. Empty/None is the DEGRADED case: the naked pass
    still runs (it is what clears a tiled mark, which has no zones worth erasing) and
    still removes marks, but the ghost-glyph risk above comes back with it. No caller
    reaches that path today — every one of them derives boxes before calling.

    THREE DIALS, all resolved here so every caller — batch, lightbox, ⚖ compare, both
    surfaces — obeys the same stored choice without threading arguments through four
    layers of service:

    * the PROMPT (`clean_prompt`): what Klein is told. Editable since 2026-08-31,
      because "remove watermark" was invisible from the app and a user whose mark
      survived had no dial to turn. It reaches `_run_klein_job(prompt=...)`; the
      caller-facing `prompt` argument stays empty on this lane by construction.
    * the SIZE (`clean_max_mp`, default 2 MP, clamped [0.5, 4.0]): the frame travels at
      that cap at most, snapped to the latent stride and never magnified
      (`_mask_frame_size`, shared with the masked lane) — a 24 MP photo is not worth
      12× the VRAM on a box that also runs ComfyUI and possibly a training run. Raise
      it for finer regenerated detail, pay for it in VRAM and seconds. The margin is
      applied in SENT pixels, where the erasing actually happens.
    * the WRITE-BACK (`clean_output_mode`): 'original' resamples the render back to the
      file's own dimensions — what shipped, and what keeps a clean from changing the
      shape of a dataset image. 'render' writes the render as it came back, so a photo
      above the cap keeps the detail the second resample would soften AND THE FILE
      CHANGES DIMENSIONS. That is the user's choice to make, said in those words on
      every surface that offers it."""
