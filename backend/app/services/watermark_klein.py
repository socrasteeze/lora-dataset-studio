"""Watermark removal by PREFILL + Flux.2 Klein full-edit refine, crop-and-stitch — the
V2 sister of watermark_lama.

Why a second method: LaMa (V1) is non-generative and perfect outside the mask, but on
complex texture (skin / fabric / busy background) it smears — the "weird mask sections"
grief — and it can't touch a mark that sits ON the subject (those stay 'review'). Klein
reconstructs texture far better AND makes the on-subject case actionable.

Architecture — PREFILL then REFINE (GPU-derived 2026-07-17, see below):

  1. crop a padded square around the mark, upscale it to ~1 MP (the "magnifying glass" so
     a few-pixel mark in a 4K photo is big enough for the model to see);
  2. PREFILL the masked region of that crop — repaint the watermark away with the LaMa
     worker (fallback cv2 TELEA). The result is deliberately soft/blurry; that is fine,
     its ONLY job is to hand Klein a reference with NO watermark left in it;
  3. Klein REFINES the pre-filled crop as a native full-edit (VAEEncode the whole crop →
     ReferenceLatent + KSampler on that latent, denoise 1.0, cfg 1 — NO SetLatentNoiseMask,
     the improve-skin edit pattern). Klein regenerates real texture over the soft prefill;
  4. HARMONIZE the refined crop's tone to the surrounding original at the seam (per zone),
     so the pasted patch has no visible tonal step — see "WHY harmonization" below;
  5. composite the harmonized crop back onto the ORIGINAL in pixel space, pasting ONLY the
     masked region (+ a few-px feather). Every pixel outside that footprint keeps its
     ORIGINAL bytes — that is THE preservation guarantee, and it holds no matter how far
     the model drifts across the (fully re-rendered) crop.

WHY the prefill is mandatory (empirical, on a real photo):
  * The masked-inpaint graph (SetLatentNoiseMask + DifferentialDiffusion, denoise 1.0)
    feeds the ORIGINAL crop as the ReferenceLatent. At cfg 1 (guidance-distilled Klein)
    the prompt barely counts against that reference — so the watermark, still visible in
    the reference, is REPRODUCED as ghost glyphs.
  * Pre-filling the reference (watermark gone) kills the ghosts — but if Klein is asked to
    only paint inside the mask it just copies the prefill's blur back. Handing Klein the
    pre-filled crop as a FULL edit lets it regenerate genuine texture over the soft patch,
    which is exactly its improve-details core competency. A Klein pass WITHOUT a prefill is
    proven ineffective, so there is no skip-prefill path — prefill or fail.

WHY harmonization is mandatory (measured on a real photo, GPU 2026-07-17):
  * The full-edit re-renders the ENTIRE crop, so Klein's output drifts globally in tone,
    colour and contrast even OUTSIDE the mask (measured on the seam ring of a real 1024²
    crop: luma -8.6, per-channel means R -8.8 / G -7.7 / B -12.6, contrast std ratio ~1.3).
  * The composite pastes ONLY the masked rectangle, so that drift lands as a hard step at
    the paste boundary — the "visible square" grief, worst on soft flats (skin, walls,
    knit) where a constant offset reads as a clean rectangle. The feather smooths the alpha
    edge but CANNOT remove a tonal offset.
  * Fix: on the "seam ring" — the band of pixels just OUTSIDE the mask, where the original
    is the ground truth Klein was meant to reproduce — measure the per-channel mean/std of
    original vs fill; that difference IS the drift. Apply the inverse per-channel affine
    (gain = orig_std/fill_std, bias to match means) to the whole patch so it lines up with
    the neighbourhood. It is a linear transform, so it PRESERVES Klein's reconstructed
    texture; it only re-seats its tone. Done PER ZONE (each mark harmonized against its own
    local ring) so a multi-mark crop spanning different lighting corrects each seam locally.
    The correction touches the PATCH only — the byte-exact preservation guarantee is intact.

The ComfyUI round-trip goes through the shared queue_manager (serialized against training
/ vision by the worker's own gating), then this module reads the finished crop back and
does the composite locally. Same `(ok, error)` tuple contract as watermark_lama."""
