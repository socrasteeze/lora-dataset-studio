"""Find a Python already on this machine that can run a heavy pass on the GPU.

The scoring extra deliberately installs CPU-only torch (Setup builds it a small
private venv rather than pushing a ~2.5 GB CUDA download on people who have no
card). On a machine that *does* have a card that default costs hours: CLIP
ViT-L/14 measures ~336 ms/image on the CPU against ~15 ms on a recent GPU.

The obvious fix — a button that pip-installs a CUDA torch — is the one we
deliberately do NOT build: it means a 2.5 GB download plus picking a wheel index
against the driver, and getting that wrong is exactly how a `--index-url`
install shredded someone's numpy. The better move is the opposite one: a machine
that trains LoRAs every day ALREADY has a proven CUDA Python (ai-toolkit's venv,
ComfyUI's, a conda env). Point the scoring pass at it instead of building a
third one.

What makes this honest rather than hopeful:

* **Every dependency, not just CUDA.** ``bank_score_infer.py`` needs torch AND
  open_clip AND transformers/timm AND numpy/Pillow. An interpreter with a
  perfect CUDA torch but no ``open_clip`` will die mid-pass. So the probe reports
  a state PER DEPENDENCY and the UI can say "ai-toolkit has CUDA but is missing
  open_clip" instead of an opaque no.
* **Read-only.** We never install anything into an environment we did not build.
  The ai-toolkit venv runs the user's training; silently pip-installing into it
  would be unacceptable. When something is missing we name it and hand over the
  exact command — the user decides.
* **Known candidates only.** Interpreters the app already knows about, plus a
  path the user types. Sweeping the disk would be slow and fragile.
* **Fail safe.** Nothing proven -> nothing changes, and the pass keeps running
  where it runs today. ``select()`` refuses any interpreter it could not verify.

The probe really imports every dependency, in an isolated interpreter that
ignores the process owner's user-site packages (``python -s``).  Merely finding
a module spec is not enough: a package can be present yet fail while importing
one of its native or transitive dependencies.  That exact false positive used
to mark a borrowed ComfyUI Python as GPU-ready while Score itself stayed off.

**Two features, one detector.** ✨ Score was the first caller; the SigLIP2
semantic index is the second, and it needs a DIFFERENT dependency list (no
open_clip, no timm) written to a DIFFERENT config key. Everything else — the
candidates, the read-only rule, the fail-safe selection — is identical, so the
module is parametrised by an :class:`InterpreterProfile` rather than copied.
Telling someone "ComfyUI's Python cannot run the semantic index" because it
lacks ``open_clip`` would be a lie: that worker never imports it.

**Borrowing is about WHERE A PASS RUNS, never about where Setup installs.**
Selecting an interpreter here writes one config key and nothing else. Setup's
install actions resolve their target from the app-managed environment on their
own and never read these keys — see ``setup_installer._bank_semantic_install_python``
and ``test_setup_installer.py``. That separation is the whole reason it is safe
to point the semantic engine at someone's ai-toolkit venv.
