"""The dedicated watermark detector — parent half.

WHY this exists at all. Finding watermarks used to mean asking a chat model, in
words, "is there a watermark in this picture?", once per image, and parsing the
sentence it wrote back. That works, and it is what still runs when this extra is
not installed — but it costs ~1.7 s per image for a question whose answer is "no"
the overwhelming majority of the time. On the reference bank of 29 759 images
that is roughly fifteen hours of GPU. A discriminative classifier answers the
same binary question in milliseconds, and it answers it with a NUMBER, which is
what makes a threshold (and therefore a measured calibration) possible.

The cascade is deliberately two models with two licences we checked at the source
(``backend/infer/watermark_detect_infer.py`` lists every dependency's licence):
SigLIP2 ranks, Florence-2 locates only what the ranker flagged. `ultralytics` is
never used — it claims AGPL-3.0 over trained weights and would contaminate this
public repository.

Contract with the caller: `scan()` is a GENERATOR yielding one result per image,
in input order, as they arrive. That shape is not decoration — the Bank pass
commits per image so a stopped scan keeps everything it already learned, and a
30 000-image batch that only reported at the end could not do that.

Fail-open, exactly like today's pass: no extra installed → `available()` is False
and the caller keeps using the vision model. A locator that cannot load →
images are still flagged, just without a box (the state the pre-box builds
shipped), and the summary says so.
