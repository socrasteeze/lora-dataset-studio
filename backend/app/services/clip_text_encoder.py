"""Turn a written query into a CLIP vector — and pay for it as rarely as possible.

The bank already holds a CLIP embedding for every ✨ Score-d image, so ranking a
bank against a sentence is one dot product per image: numpy does it in-process in
milliseconds. The ONE expensive step is producing the SENTENCE's vector, because
torch/open_clip are not in the Flask venv.

Measured on the reference machine (ai-toolkit venv, torch 2.9.1, CPU forced):

    import torch + open_clip .................. 5.4 s
    build model + load weights ................ 2.4 s
    encode_text, first call ................... 24-48 ms
    encode_text, subsequent calls ............. 20-25 ms
    whole one-shot subprocess, launch → exit ... 8.5-8.8 s
    peak RSS .................................. 2.43 GB

Those numbers decide the design. 8.5 s to encode three words, of which 7.8 s is
pure start-up, makes "one subprocess per search" untenable — and search is
iterative by nature, so the user pays it on every refinement. But the flip side
is 2.43 GB held for as long as a model stays resident, which on a modest machine
is a lot to spend on a feature used in bursts.

So the arbitration is three-layered, cheapest first:

1. **A persistent query cache.** A CLIP text vector depends only on the
   checkpoint, so it is written next to the banks and re-read forever, across
   restarts, app-wide. A re-typed or favourite phrase costs nothing and does not
   even wake the worker. This is the only layer that survives a restart.
2. **A lazily-started WARM worker.** The first uncached query of a session starts
   the child and pays the ~8.5 s load; every later one costs ~20 ms. Nothing is
   started at boot and nothing is started for a cache hit — an install that never
   searches never pays a byte.
3. **An idle reaper.** The worker exits after ``bank_scoring.text_search_idle_minutes``
   without a query (default 10). Ten minutes covers a realistic refine-and-retry
   session while guaranteeing the 2.43 GB is never held overnight or through an
   unattended training run. Setting it to 0 disables the warm layer entirely —
   the honest choice on a memory-tight machine, where paying 8.5 s per distinct
   phrase beats surrendering 2.4 GB. ``release()`` reaps it immediately when the
   user closes the search panel; the timer is the backstop for a closed tab.

**CPU, always.** The text tower is small and the cost is the load, not the maths,
so the GPU would buy nothing measurable and would make a search collide with a
training run. The child hides CUDA from itself, no GPU window is ever taken, and
a search works fine WHILE a LoRA trains — it competes for RAM, never for VRAM.

**No silent download.** open_clip fetches ~1.6 GB of ViT-L/14 weights on first
use. Text search never triggers that on its own: it refuses outright unless the
bank already HAS ✨ Score embeddings, which means this machine already downloaded
this exact checkpoint to produce them. The one residual case — the user re-pointed
``bank_scoring.python``/``models_root`` at an environment with a different cache
since scoring — is reported by ``weights_warning()`` so the UI can warn BEFORE the
click rather than stall for ten minutes.
