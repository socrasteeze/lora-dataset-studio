"""Fail-closed ownership fence for LDS-managed local Ollama models.

Ollama is a separate process: a successful ``keep_alive: 0`` request is not a
proof that its CUDA allocation has already disappeared.  LDS therefore records
every local model it asks to run, then verifies ``/api/ps`` is empty before a
ComfyUI workflow may load its own models.  Remote Ollama endpoints do not share
this machine's GPU and are deliberately never probed or unloaded here.
