# that — reported on Reddit by Psyko_2000). So we do not guess a layout: we knock
# on the folder and on each of its immediate sub-folders with every interpreter
# shape the app already knows (`scoring_python._INTERPRETER_SPOTS`) and keep the
# ones that answer as a real file. An empty list means "we found nothing here",
# which is a fact the UI can state honestly — never a claim that a venv is the
# only way. Nothing is executed and nothing is written; it is a stat() sweep one
# level deep, computed only for a checkout whose interpreter we could not resolve.
