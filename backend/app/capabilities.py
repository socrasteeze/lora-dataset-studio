    False here is never a refusal: the Find pass keeps using the vision model,

    ORDER IS DELIBERATE — the filesystem check runs FIRST. The import check is a
    subprocess that runs `import torch`, and on the overwhelmingly common machine
    (this extra not installed) that subprocess can never change the answer, since
    no weights means not-ready whatever imports. Probing the other way round made
    every capability poll — and every test that drops the probe cache — pay a
    torch import for a capability nobody has. That cost is paid by every agent and
    every CI run, forever, which is precisely how a suite drifts from minutes to
