    # watermark_max is the ONE cut here that ships with a number, and the reason

    # of someone's footage (which is why the published defaults land at the 7th
    # percentile of this machine's bank); a watermark score is a CLASSIFIER's

# --- engines added by an update --------------------------------------------
# _deep_merge REPLACES lists (it only recurses into dicts), which is right for
# every other list we store — but engines.enabled doubles as "which engines
# exist", so a config saved before an engine shipped pinned its owner to the old
# catalogue forever: the more someone used the app, the fewer new engines they
# got, with no hint one existed. New SCALAR keys never had this problem, they
# fall back to their default; this is a list-only failure mode.
#
# The whole difficulty is telling "this engine didn't exist when I saved" from
# "I unchecked this on purpose" — blindly adding back what's missing would undo
# an explicit choice, which is worse than the bug. So a save records the
# catalogue the choice was made from (engines.known), and only engines absent
# from that ledger are merged in on read. Configs written before the ledger
# existed have no such record, but we know from the shipping history exactly
# which engines they could have been offered. On THIS fork that history is a
# single entry: the API engines were removed in 2026-07-19, before any config
# this build reads could have been written, so Klein is the only engine a
# pre-ledger config was ever offered — which is precisely what makes Krea 2 Edit
# reach installs that had already saved their Settings.

# ^ never extend this tuple. A new engine goes in DEFAULTS['engines']['enabled']
# and nowhere else; adding it here would mean "everyone has already seen it",
# i.e. exactly the bug this fixes.
#
# Only ONE key in DEFAULTS is a list of choices (engines.enabled) — the other
# list, klein.generation_lora_presets, is pure user data with an empty default
# and nothing to merge. Hence a named, tested helper rather than a framework;
