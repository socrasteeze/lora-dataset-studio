"""🎬 Video bank API — triage a folder of rushes before it becomes a training set.

Deliberately the same surface as the 🗃️ image bank: heavy passes return 202 and
run in ONE background thread per bank, the UI polls GET /video-bank/<id> whose
payload embeds the live job, and 409 means a pass already owns this bank. A user
does not know there are two services behind the app and should not be able to
tell — so the status codes, the `busy_kind` field and the payload shape are
copied rather than reinvented.

The one place the two lanes differ is promotion, and it differs because of the
architecture rather than the API: promoting is where the video lane finally
ENCODES something, so it takes a target profile and a clip length, and everything
that could be refused is refused synchronously before a dataset exists.

    empty/absent = every kept clip. `max_per_source` caps how many clips ONE
    source may contribute (absent/null = no cap), which is what keeps a 50-clip
    dataset from quietly being three videos over-represented. `edge_inset_s`
    trims that many seconds off
    BOTH bounds of every clip (default 0 — a shot boundary is where a cut just
    happened, but turning that on by default would silently change what every
    existing recipe exports).

    202 {'ok', 'id', 'name', 'output_dir', 'clips'} — the id rides back so the UI
    can navigate straight to the dataset being filled. 400 names a legal frame
    count or a valid size; 503 means ffmpeg is missing; 409 means a pass is running.

    This is the ONLY route in the lane that writes media, by design: a bank stores
    bounds, and encoding 340 clips to keep 128 is what that design avoids."""
