# Every write route reads its body with `get_json(silent=True) or {}`: a body that
# does not parse becomes an EMPTY one, so the route runs with no input, saves, and
# answers 200 while the value the caller sent is simply absent. The natural way to
# hit it is a raw Windows path in a hand-written body (`"C:\ai-toolkit"` — `\a` is
# not a JSON escape), which is exactly how it was reported: a settings save that
# said OK and stored nothing.
#
# Rather than convert ~110 call sites (and depend on the next one remembering),
# the parse is made strict once, at the request boundary: an unreadable body never
# reaches a view, so it can never be mistaken for an empty one. The call sites keep
# their `or {}` — past this guard it only means "no body", which stays legitimate.
