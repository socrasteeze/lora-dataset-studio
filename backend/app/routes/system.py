"""🖥️ System — server-side folder pickers, and the global stop.

The folders the app works on live on the machine RUNNING the server (not the
browser's), so these two endpoints do the selecting there:

  POST /api/system/pick-folder   pops the OS-native dialog on the server desktop.
  GET  /api/system/list-folders  read-only in-app browser (drives + subfolders).

And the way out of a wedged GPU:

  GET  /api/system/gpu-flags        what the "GPU busy" gate believes, and whether
                                    anything actually backs it up.
  POST /api/system/gpu-flags/clear  clear a STALE flag, refusing while something
                                    real is running.
  POST /api/system/stop-everything  cancel every running job, ask ComfyUI and the
                                    trainer to stop, then clear the flags — with a
                                    per-target report, never a blanket "ok".
It also hosts the app-wide ComfyUI recovery surface (GET/POST
/api/system/comfyui-recovery…), which belongs here for the same reason: it is
about the machine running the server, not about any one dataset.

pick-folder never 500s on the expected "no desktop here" case — it answers 200
with {available:false} so the UI silently falls back to the in-app browser
(LAN/tablet/Linux) instead of flashing a scary error toast.
