# --- Content types for our own static files ---------------------------------
# Flask/Werkzeug label every file they send with `mimetypes.guess_type()`. On
# Windows that module seeds itself from the registry
# (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<ext>\Content Type), which ANY installed program is free to
# overwrite — so the type a browser is told depends on what else happens to be on
# the machine. When `.js` has been rewritten to `text/plain`, the browser refuses
# to execute the bundle and the app opens on a blank page with nothing at all in
# the server log. Reported, diagnosed AND fixed by gessyoo (GitHub #12); the same
# lottery has been observed hitting `.mjs` on a different machine, so this is not
# one broken PC.
#
# The cure is to never ask the registry what our own files are. Every value below
# is the standard one — the very value Python's built-in table carries when no
# registry is involved — so on a healthy machine (and on Linux/macOS) this pins
# what was already being served and changes nothing observable. It only ever
# repairs a downgrade; it never invents a type for an extension we don't ship.
