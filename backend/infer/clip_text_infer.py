"""CLIP text tower — turn a written query into the SAME 768-d space the ✨ Score
pass already put every bank image in, run in the dedicated "bank scoring" ML
interpreter (torch/open_clip are not in the Flask venv).

This is the missing half of bank_score_infer.py. That script loads CLIP
ViT-L/14 and calls `encode_image`; the model it loads carries a text tower too,
which nothing has ever used. Here we load the same checkpoint and call
`encode_text` instead — so "brunette outdoors, wide shot" becomes a vector that
can be cosine-compared against the cached image embeddings with no new model, no
new download and no new dependency.

⚠ THE MODEL SPEC IS A CONTRACT, NOT A CHOICE.
``MODEL_NAME``/``PRETRAINED`` below MUST stay byte-identical to what
``bank_score_infer.py`` passes to ``create_model_and_transforms``. Two vectors
produced by different CLIP configurations are not comparable: the dot product
still returns plausible-looking numbers and a ranking that means nothing — a
silent failure with no error and no crash, invisible on "roughly right" results.
``backend/tests/test_clip_text_model_contract.py`` fails if the two drift apart.

Known, deliberate consequence: open_clip warns that the `openai` ViT-L-14 weights
were trained with QuickGELU while `'ViT-L-14'` (no `-quickgelu` suffix) builds a
plain-GELU model. Every cached bank embedding in the wild was produced that way,
so the text side reproduces it EXACTLY. Fixing the activation is a separate
migration (it invalidates every scored bank), never a side effect of this file.

Protocol — a WARM WORKER, because loading CLIP costs ~8 s and encoding a
sentence costs ~20 ms (measured, CPU). The parent starts one, keeps it for a
short idle window, and pays the load once per session rather than once per
search:

  stdout, once ready : {"ok": true, "ready": true, "dim": 768}
  stdin,  per query  : {"text": "brunette outdoors, wide shot"}\n
  stdout, per query  : {"ok": true, "vector": [768 floats]}\n
                       {"ok": false, "error": "..."}\n
  EOF on stdin       : clean exit.
A fatal load failure prints {"ok": false, "ready": false, "error": ...} and exits.

CPU ON PURPOSE. The text tower is small and one sentence is microseconds of
compute — the entire cost is the model LOAD. Taking the GPU for that would make
a search race the training run and the captioning pass this project already
serialises against each other, for no speed the user could notice. So CUDA is
hidden from the child outright and the parent never takes a GPU window.
