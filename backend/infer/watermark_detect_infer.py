"""Dedicated overlaid-watermark detector — the fast, discriminative replacement
for asking a chat model "is there a watermark?" 29 000 times.

Runs in the DEDICATED "watermark detector" interpreter (torch/transformers are not
in the Flask venv), same subprocess family as bank_score_infer.py.

Two models, two jobs, both permissively licensed — that is not an accident but the
whole reason this cascade exists (see LICENSES below):

  * RANK  — ``prithivMLmods/Watermark-Detection-SigLIP2`` (Apache-2.0). A SigLIP2
    image classifier fine-tuned on 22 762 images for the single binary question
    "is there an overlaid watermark". One forward per image, no text decoding, so
    it answers in milliseconds where a VLM spends ~1.7 s writing a sentence. It
    returns a PROBABILITY, which is what makes a tunable threshold possible at all.
  * LOCATE — ``IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny`` (Apache-2.0), zero-shot object
    detection prompted with the phrases below. Only ever run on images the ranker
    already flagged, because localisation is the expensive half and most images
    are clean. Its boxes are what the Bank's ✂ crop / 🧽 inpaint levels route on,
    so a detector that only said yes/no would be a downgrade from the VLM it
    replaces.

WHY NOT Florence-2, which the research picked for this second stage: it does not
load. ``microsoft/Florence-2-base-ft`` ships its modelling code IN the repo
(trust_remote_code), written against transformers ~4.4x, and on a current
transformers it dies with ``'Florence2LanguageConfig' object has no attribute
'forced_bos_token_id'`` — that attribute moved out of PretrainedConfig in
transformers 5. Pinning transformers down was the wrong price: this extra
deliberately shares the bank-scoring environment (so the user is not asked for a
second 2.5 GB copy of torch), and holding that whole environment back for one
unmaintained remote file would put the ✨ Score NSFW classifier at risk too.
Grounding DINO answers the same "phrase in, boxes out" question, is integrated
NATIVELY in transformers (no remote code, no flash-attn workaround, no version
roulette) and is Apache-2.0.

LICENSES (verified at the source repo, not from a mirror's README):

Nothing here is AGPL. `ultralytics` is deliberately NOT used at any point: it
claims AGPL-3.0 over trained WEIGHTS, which would contaminate this public repo,
and the best public watermark YOLO descends from a checkpoint with no declared
licence at all.

Protocol (streaming, unlike the batch workers — the parent commits per image and
must be able to stop a 30 000-image pass without losing what it already learned):
  stdin  : ONE json object
           {"images": [abs paths], "threshold": 0.60, "locate": true,
            "device": "auto"|"cuda"|"cpu", "models_root": path|null,
            "cancel_file": path|null}
  stdout : ONE json line PER IMAGE, in input order:
           {"path": str, "state": "detected"|"none"|"error",
            "score": float|null, "regions": [[x1,y1,x2,y2], ...],
            "error": str|null}
           then a final line {"summary": {...}}.
  stderr : "[wmdet] i/N state" progress lines + load diagnostics.

A per-image failure is a row with state "error", never a dead pass: one unreadable
file out of thirty thousand must not cost the other 29 999.
