"""Dedicated overlaid-watermark detector — the fast, discriminative replacement
for asking a chat model "is there a watermark?" 29 000 times.

Runs in the DEDICATED "watermark detector" interpreter (torch/transformers are not
in the Flask venv), same subprocess family as bank_score_infer.py.

Two models, two jobs, both permissively licensed — that is not an accident but the
whole reason this cascade exists (see LICENSES below):

  * RANK  — ``prithivMLmods/Watermark-Detection-SigLIP2`` (Apache-2.0). A SigLIP2
    image classifier fine-tuned on 22 762 images for the single binary question
    "is there an overlaid watermark". One forward per image, no text decoding, so
    it answers in milliseconds where a VLM spends ~1.7 s writing a sentence. It
    returns a PROBABILITY, which is what makes a tunable threshold possible at all.
  * LOCATE — ``IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny`` (Apache-2.0), zero-shot object
    detection prompted with the phrases below. Only ever run on images the ranker
    already flagged, because localisation is the expensive half and most images
    are clean. Its boxes are what the Bank's ✂ crop / 🧽 inpaint levels route on,
    so a detector that only said yes/no would be a downgrade from the VLM it
    replaces.

WHY NOT Florence-2, which the research picked for this second stage: it does not
load. ``microsoft/Florence-2-base-ft`` ships its modelling code IN the repo
(trust_remote_code), written against transformers ~4.4x, and on a current
transformers it dies with ``'Florence2LanguageConfig' object has no attribute
'forced_bos_token_id'`` — that attribute moved out of PretrainedConfig in
transformers 5. Pinning transformers down was the wrong price: this extra
deliberately shares the bank-scoring environment (so the user is not asked for a
second 2.5 GB copy of torch), and holding that whole environment back for one
unmaintained remote file would put the ✨ Score NSFW classifier at risk too.
Grounding DINO answers the same "phrase in, boxes out" question, is integrated
NATIVELY in transformers (no remote code, no flash-attn workaround, no version
roulette) and is Apache-2.0.

LICENSES (verified at the source repo, not from a mirror's README):

Nothing here is AGPL. `ultralytics` is deliberately NOT used at any point: it
claims AGPL-3.0 over trained WEIGHTS, which would contaminate this public repo,
and the best public watermark YOLO descends from a checkpoint with no declared
licence at all.

Protocol (streaming, unlike the batch workers — the parent commits per image and
must be able to stop a 30 000-image pass without losing what it already learned):
  stdin  : ONE json object
           {"images": [abs paths], "threshold": 0.60, "locate": true,
            "device": "auto"|"cuda"|"cpu", "models_root": path|null,
            "cancel_file": path|null}
  stdout : ONE json line PER IMAGE, in input order:
           {"path": str, "state": "detected"|"none"|"error",
            "score": float|null, "regions": [[x1,y1,x2,y2], ...],
            "error": str|null}
           then a final line {"summary": {...}}.
  stderr : "[wmdet] i/N state" progress lines + load diagnostics.

A per-image failure is a row with state "error", never a dead pass: one unreadable
file out of thirty thousand must not cost the other 29 999.

# pass found 4, the tiled sweep all 7. Tiles are noisier — a tile promotes rock
# texture to "a logo" — so the tile passes demand a HIGHER confidence, and the

# WHERE a mark is and HOW FAR IT REACHES are two different questions, and the

# stays decided by the strict consensus above; once it is confirmed, a box that
# only clears this floor may EXTEND that zone, never create one.
#
# Measured on the maintainer's seven-logo photo (2048x1365, an emblem above a
# two-line caption): the caption alone is boxed at 0.502 and reported as the
# zone, while the emblem right above it is boxed at 0.349 by this prompt and
# 0.323 by the validator — both under LOCATE_TILE_THRESHOLD. So the zone
# stopped at the text (y1 0.551 for a mark starting at 0.470), the clean
# pre-erased only what the zone covered, and the re-render put the emblem back
# as a ghost glyph. With the rescue the same zone starts at 0.480.
#
# The floor IS the full-frame floor, deliberately not a new number: a box
# confident enough to be reported on its own at full frame is confident enough
# to say how far a CONFIRMED mark extends. Swept on the ground-truth bench (57
# marks stamped in known positions over 3 real photos), everything else held at
# what this file ships, measuring how much of each stamped mark its zone covers
# (completeness) against how much of the reported zone falls outside every mark
# (spill — the counter-metric, because "grow everything" maximises the first):
#     0.35 (= tile floor: rescue off)  completeness 0.71  spill 0.412
#     0.30                             completeness 0.75  spill 0.416
#     0.25                             completeness 0.79  spill 0.416   <- here

# Below 0.25 the zones stop growing over marks and start growing over the
# picture: completeness flattens while spill climbs. Recall holds at 46/57
# throughout and precision at 46/50 -> 43/47, where the three "lost" zones are

# guard exists for union to 0.70 and above, the genuinely tiled photo to 0.99,
# while photos carrying one or two isolated marks land at 0.41..0.50. 0.50 is
# in that gap, and the gap is what the number is for: left at 0.40 the guard
# goes on blanking the corner-logo scenarios (0 of 3 located instead of 1, for
# a headline precision of 100% bought by reporting nothing), and at 0.60 it
# stops catching claims it should catch. The reported precision is LOWER here
# than at 0.40 (92% vs 100%) and that is the trade being made on purpose: a
# guard that hides every zone of every one-mark photo scores perfectly and
# helps nobody.

# image too small to tile (tile_plan returns the single full-frame pass), the

# "the whole picture is a logo" two or three times — and those claims alone
# push the union past the guard with no repeated mark involved. Measured on six
# 474px-wide images: a CLEAN thumbnail unions to 0.32, a stock placard carrying
# one word to 0.59, another to 0.88. The guard was blanking the word it had
# just located: two Shutterstock thumbnails came back "flagged, no position".
#
# So on an untiled sweep the same question — is the mark EVERYWHERE? — is put
# to the biggest single box instead, which is the shape a genuinely tiled
# picture produces and a failed localisation does not. Measured over the 21
# images of the bench, largest single geometry-prompt box per image:
#     the tiled stock photo          0.958 (full size) / 0.983 (474px thumb)
#     every other image              0.860 and below (stock placards 0.57/0.86,
#                                    clean photos 0.16..0.33, logo photos 0.03)
# 0.90 sits in that gap, nearer the failed-localisation population on purpose:
# erring low reproduces today's behaviour (blank), erring high would report two
# tiles of a tiling as if they were the whole mark. With it, both thumbnails
# report their word, the tiled photo stays guarded at BOTH scales, and every
# tiled-sweep image of the ground truth is untouched (46/57 recall, 92%
# precision, tiled photo 14 zones, cleaned photo 0 — all unchanged).
#
# Known cost, measured and not papered over: a thumbnail of a tiled photo whose
# claim lands UNDER 0.90 would report the two tiles it found. Nothing in the
# boxes separates that case from a placard carrying two marks — the two are
# geometrically identical (a frame-wide claim plus two mark-sized boxes over
# ~9% of the frame) — so the trade is which error to make, and the maintainer's
# call (2026-08-31) is that a located word beats a silent flag.
