"""🔳 Where the letters are — RapidOCR over already-extracted frames, on CPU.

WHY RapidOCR AND NOT THE OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVES. The two heads this repo already
ships could both be pointed at text and both would be the wrong tool. The
watermark detector (SigLIP2 + Grounding DINO) answers "is a mark present" with a
scalar and needs ~2 GB of torch; the caption model reads a scene, not a
rectangle. What this pass needs is BOXES — a position and a size, three times per
shot, thousands of times per bank — and that is a detector's job, not a
classifier's or a VLM's.

RapidOCR is the one that fits without a new environment. It is Apache-2.0 (this
repo is public, and `ultralytics`' AGPL-over-weights claim is exactly why the
watermark detector is not built on it), it runs on the CPU onnxruntime the app
ALREADY installs for face scoring and masks, and its 1.4.x wheels carry the
PP-OCRv4 ONNX models INSIDE the package — 16 MB, no download, so this works on a
machine with no egress on the day it is installed. It is also what the pipelines
this pass copies use: Cosmos Curator's "Artificial Text Filter" is PaddleOCR, and
these are the same PP-OCR weights without the Paddle runtime.

THE CARD IS NEVER TAKEN. onnxruntime CPU only, deliberately: the whole point of
this pass is that it can measure a bank while a training run owns the GPU. There
is no `auto` branch to get wrong.

Measured on this machine, 768 px frames, CPU: 0.86 s to import, 0.55 s to build
the engine, 0.61 s per frame warm. Three frames per shot puts a thousand-shot
bank around half an hour — real money, which is why the pass has its own button
rather than riding somebody else's, and why the parent reports progress per
frame instead of per chunk.

Protocol (one JSON line in, one JSON line out — a batch, not a warm worker):
  stdin  : {"frames": [{"key": "<clip id>:<label>", "path": "<abs jpeg>"}, ...],
            "score_min": 0.5, "cancel_file": path|null}
  stdout : {"ok": true, "boxes": {"<key>": [[x0,y0,x1,y1,score], ...]},
            "read": N, "stopped": bool}
           {"ok": false, "error": "<ExcType>: <message>"}
  stderr : "[text] i/N" progress lines — the parent's only progress source.

BOXES COME BACK NORMALISED, 0..1, axis-aligned. Normalised because the parent
compares boxes ACROSS frames and a shot's frames are all the same shape but no
particular size, and because a stored measurement in pixels stops meaning
anything the day the extraction size changes. Axis-aligned because RapidOCR
returns a quadrilateral (it handles rotated text) and every consumer here — IoU
clustering, union area, edge cuts — is a rectangle problem; the bounding box of
the quad is the conservative choice, which is the right direction for a
measurement that justifies a crop.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE HERE: no clustering, no coverage, no verdict. Those
are product decisions with arguments attached and they live in
app/services/video_safe_zone_geometry.py, where the tests can exercise them
without onnxruntime — the same split video_aesthetic_infer.py keeps from
video_metrics.aesthetic_of.

    measured: an accented folder name returns None with a findDecoder

    did, their temp dir is ASCII. So a None falls through to PIL, which is
