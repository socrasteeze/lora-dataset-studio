"""🔤 The text-zone filler — bubble-aware cleaning, on CPU, no model at all.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The repaint level used to hand LaMa the whole RECTANGLE of a
text zone. A rectangle overshoots a speech bubble by construction (the merge
pad that folds lines together also bites the outline), so LaMa — which
regenerates everything it covers — kept eating balloon outlines and cartouche
borders. The maintainer's pages showed exactly that: emptied bubbles with
half-dissolved rims.

WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD, per zone — the scanlation cleaners' method, measured on
real webtoon pages rather than borrowed as folklore:

  1. Ink mask (Otsu). Every ink component that TOUCHES the zone border is
     PRESERVED: a letter is a small closed shape inside the zone, while a
     balloon outline or the art always crosses the box edge. That one rule is
     what makes broken bubbles impossible.
  2. The background is judged in the RING right around the kept glyphs —
     inside the balloon by construction. Judging the whole rectangle mixes in
     the art and misclassifies every real bubble (measured).
  3. Near-pure background (≥60 % of ring pixels within ±2 of the dominant
     colour): flatten the whole glyph neighbourhood to that EXACT colour.
     Not a median, not an inpaint: these pages are pure-255 white with a
     252-254 JPEG-ringing veil around each letter, and any averaging fill
     leaves the text as a one-grey-level relief the eye reads as a ghost —
     found only because the maintainer preferred LaMa's output at 1:1.
  4. Genuinely graded background: TELEA inpaint over the deviating pixels.
  5. Busy background (art behind the text): nothing is painted here — the
     glyph-tight boxes are RETURNED so the caller can run LaMa on just the
     letters instead of the whole rectangle.

Needs cv2 + numpy only — both guaranteed by the `video_text` capability this
lane already requires (the probe imports them). No torch, no weights, no GPU.

Protocol (one JSON line in, one out — a batch, like video_text_infer):
  stdin  : {"items": [{"image_path": "<abs>", "regions": [[x0,y0,x1,y1], ...]},
            ...], "cancel_file": path|null}
  stdout : {"ok": true, "results": {"<image_path>": {"ok": bool,
            "filled": N, "busy_boxes": [[x0,y0,x1,y1], ...], "error": str?}},
            "stopped": bool}
           {"ok": false, "error": "<ExcType>: <message>"}
  stderr : "[fill] i/N" progress lines.

Regions and busy_boxes are NORMALISED [x0,y0,x1,y1] in 0..1 — the exact
contract the mask channel and the LaMa router already speak. Images are
rewritten IN PLACE (the caller hands staged copies, never user files), with
unicode-safe I/O throughout: plain cv2.imread/imwrite cannot open non-ASCII
paths on Windows, the exact failure that produced a phantom 'cancelled' on a
real bank.
