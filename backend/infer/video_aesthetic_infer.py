"""🎨 The LAION aesthetic head over vectors that ALREADY EXIST — no decode, no CLIP.

The cheapest member of this folder, and the reason it can exist at all is that
the video lane already embedded three frames of every shot into the SAME space
the image bank's ✨ Score pass uses: open_clip ViT-L/14 (openai), 768-d,
L2-normalised. The improved-aesthetic-predictor head is a 768→1 MLP over exactly
that vector, so rating a whole bank is one small matmul over an .npz that is
already on disk — no video is opened, no frame is decoded, CLIP is never loaded.

WHY IT IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT AND NOT A BRANCH OF bank_score_infer.py. That one
takes IMAGE PATHS: it opens files, runs CLIP, runs the NSFW classifier and
maintains its own embedding cache. Every one of those steps is exactly what this
must not do. What the two DO share is the head itself, and that is imported from
there rather than copied — one URL, one filename, one MLP shape, one cache
directory. A second copy of those four facts is how a video score and an image
score end up on two different scales while both look plausible.

THE CARD IS NEVER TAKEN. This is ~1 GFLOP per thousand frames; CUDA is hidden
before torch is imported so a bank can be rated while a training run owns the
GPU. The only real cost is the torch import itself, which is why the parent skips
this whole subprocess when every shot already has a score.

Protocol (one JSON line in, one JSON line out — this is a batch, not a worker):
  stdin  : {"store": "<abs path to a clip_embeddings.npz>",
            "models_root": path|null}
  stdout : {"ok": true, "scores": {"<clip_id>": [float, ...]}, "frames": N}
           {"ok": false, "error": "<ExcType>: <message>"}
  stderr : "[look] …" progress lines; the parent does not parse them.

PER-FRAME SCORES, NOT A PER-CLIP ONE. How several frames become one number is a
product decision with an argument attached (see `video_metrics.aesthetic_of`),
and it belongs in the pure module the tests can exercise without torch — not in
a subprocess nobody can run in CI.
