"""Bank face pass — InsightFace antelopev2 embeddings + person clustering, run
in the DEDICATED ML interpreter (insightface/numpy are not in the Flask venv).
Device is chosen by the parent: 'cpu' (default — never touches the GPU/ComfyUI)
or 'cuda' (only when onnxruntime-gpu is present; the parent then runs this pass
inside its GPU-exclusive window). CUDA requested but unavailable → CPU fallback.

Protocol (same family as face_score_infer.py):
  stdin  : {"images": [abs paths], "models_root": path|null,
            "cache": abs path to a .npz|null, "threshold": 0.45,
            "device": "cpu"|"cuda", "require_yaw": bool,
            "groups": [{"name": str, "images": [abs paths]}]  # OPTIONAL}
  stdout : ONE JSON line {"ok": bool,
            "results": {path: {state, det, bbox_frac, yaw|null}},
            "clusters": {path: int}, "used_gpu": bool, "error"?: str,
            "group_clusters": {name: {path: int}}  # only when groups was given}
  stderr : "[embed] i/N <state>" progress lines (the parent streams these to
            drive the UI progress bar).

Embeddings are CACHED in the .npz (parallel arrays paths/embs/states/dets/
bfracs/yaws/sigs/hashes) and written incrementally every CACHE_EVERY images — killing the
pass mid-way loses at most that slice, and re-clustering at another threshold is
then near-instant.

``yaws`` is the newest array and every cache written before it exists lacks it.
Those entries load with yaw = NaN and are reported as ``yaw: null`` — "not
measured", never 0.0, which would read as a perfectly frontal face. ``require_yaw``
asks for those entries to be RE-DETECTED (the angle is not recoverable from the
stored embedding); it is what the app's opt-in ⤢ backfill sets, and it is off by
default so an ordinary resume never turns into hours of re-detection.

Clustering = union-find over cosine ≥ threshold on the
L2-normed embeddings of the SCORABLE faces (biggest face per image — a group
photo clusters by its dominant face); cluster ids are 1-based, ordered by
cluster size descending, singletons included (a person seen once is still a
cluster of one)."""
