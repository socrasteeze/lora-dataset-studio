"""Bank face pass — InsightFace antelopev2 embeddings + person clustering, run
in the DEDICATED ML interpreter (insightface/numpy are not in the Flask venv).
Device is chosen by the parent: 'cpu' (default — never touches the GPU/ComfyUI)
or 'cuda' (only when onnxruntime-gpu is present; the parent then runs this pass
inside its GPU-exclusive window). CUDA requested but unavailable → CPU fallback.

Protocol (same family as face_score_infer.py):
  stdin  : {"images": [abs paths], "models_root": path|null,
            "cache": abs path to a .npz|null, "threshold": 0.45,
            "device": "cpu"|"cuda", "require_yaw": bool,
            "regate_too_small": bool,
            "groups": [{"name": str, "images": [abs paths]}]  # OPTIONAL}
  stdout : ONE JSON line {"ok": bool,
            "results": {path: {state, det, bbox_frac, yaw|null}},
            "clusters": {path: int}, "used_gpu": bool, "error"?: str,
            "group_clusters": {name: {path: int}}  # only when groups was given}
  stderr : "[embed] i/N <state>" progress lines (the parent streams these to
            drive the UI progress bar).

Embeddings are CACHED in the .npz (parallel arrays paths/embs/states/dets/
bfracs/yaws/bpx/sigs/hashes) and written incrementally every CACHE_EVERY images — killing the
pass mid-way loses at most that slice, and re-clustering at another threshold is
then near-instant.

``yaws`` and ``bpx`` were added after the fact and every cache written before
each of them lacks it. Those entries load with NaN — for the yaw, reported as
``yaw: null`` ("not measured", never 0.0, which would read as a perfectly frontal
face); for ``bpx``, the pixel size of the face this entry's verdict was taken on.
Both are ADDITIVE: nobody ever has to re-embed a bank because a new number
joined the tuple.

Two OPT-IN flags ask for cached entries to be RE-DETECTED, because neither
number is recoverable from a stored embedding. Both are off by default, so an
ordinary resume never turns into hours of re-detection:

  * ``require_yaw`` — entries with no measured angle. It is what the app's ⤢
    backfill sets.
  * ``regate_too_small`` — entries a PRE-``bpx`` build filed as ``too_small``.
    Their verdict came from the old gate, a fraction of the image AREA, which
    dropped most faces in an ordinary photo library (see FACE_PX_MIN below);
    the pixel size that would settle them under the new floor was never stored
    and CANNOT be recomputed from the fraction alone (the image dimensions are
    not in the cache either), so the only honest answer is to look again.
    Deliberately narrow: only ``too_small`` entries with no ``bpx`` qualify.
    Legacy entries under any other state keep the verdict they hold — the new
    floor exists to ADD faces to their person, never to demote a face that
    already clusters.

Update path for a bank that was scanned before this floor existed: a re-run of
👥 Group by person re-detects NOTHING by itself. ``_needs_work``/``_is_stale``
only reach an image whose bytes changed (stat signature + SHA-256), so every
already-cached verdict — including every old ``too_small`` — is returned as-is;
images ADDED to the bank, or edited, get the new floor immediately, and so does
any bank scanned for the first time. Freeing the faces an old scan skipped
therefore takes a caller passing ``regate_too_small``; nothing in the app sets
it yet (the ⤢ backfill is the shape that action would take).

Clustering = union-find over cosine ≥ threshold on the
L2-normed embeddings of the SCORABLE faces (biggest face per image — a group
photo clusters by its dominant face); cluster ids are 1-based, ordered by
cluster size descending, singletons included (a person seen once is still a
cluster of one)."""
