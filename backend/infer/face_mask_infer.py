"""Face-mask generator — InsightFace (antelopev2), run by the DEDICATED ML
interpreter (insightface/numpy are not in the Flask venv). Same subprocess
pattern as face_score_infer.py / mask_infer.py.

WHAT THIS WRITES IS THE OPPOSITE POLARITY OF mask_infer.py.
  mask_infer.py  -> person WHITE on black background  (learn the subject, not the room)
  this script    -> face BLACK on a white frame       (learn the whole scene, not the identity)

ai-toolkit reads the PNG as a per-pixel LOSS WEIGHT (dataloader_mixins: white -> 1.0,
black -> mask_min_value; SDTrainer: loss = loss * mask). So a black face does NOT
erase pixels and does NOT paint anything into the image — it tells the trainer "do
not correct me here". That is why this is a loss mask and not a blur: a blurred face
would BE the regression target and the LoRA would learn to produce blur.

stdin  : {"images": [paths...], "out_dir": path|null, "expand": float}
stdout : last line = JSON {"ok", "written", "results": {path: {...}}}
Logs -> stderr.

`out_dir` null = DETECT ONLY (no file written): the preview path asks for the raw
boxes and grows them client-side, so moving the expand slider redraws instantly
instead of paying for another InsightFace pass.
