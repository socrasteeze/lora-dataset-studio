"""🤖 D3's second-order temporal statistic, over one 2-second window of a shot.

WHAT THIS COMPUTES, and it is ten lines of arithmetic. Each frame of a short
contiguous window is encoded independently into one vector; the L2 distance
between consecutive vectors is how much the picture CHANGED between those two
instants; the difference of those distances is how much that rate of change
itself changed. Real footage varies that second quantity constantly — a hand
shakes, a subject accelerates, light flickers, the sensor is noisy. A generated
clip, on the evidence of the 2023-24 generators the method was measured on,
does not: its motion is smoother than the world's.

    D3: Training-free AI-Generated Video Detection Using Second-Order Features
    (Chende Zheng et al., ICCV 2025) — arXiv:2508.00701,
    github.com/Zig-HS/D3, MIT. Formula (8), and models/D3_model.py.

PORTED RATHER THAN DEPENDED ON. The reference repo is a research harness: it
pins numpy 2.3.3 (this app's ceiling is <2, for insightface's ABI), it drags
moviepy 1.x to read a duration ffprobe already knows, and its albumentations pin
is incompatible with its own augmentation call. MIT lets us take the ten lines
that matter and leave the harness, so that is what this is — the arithmetic,
under this app's own dependency floors.

THE REDUCTION ORDER IS THE PART TO GET RIGHT, and the intuitive reading of the
paper's prose gets it wrong. It is NOT the std of the second differences of the
feature VECTORS. The vector is collapsed to a SCALAR distance first, and the
differencing happens on that 1-D series:

    f[t]        per-frame feature, 768-d, NOT normalised
    d[k]        = ||f[k+1] - f[k]||          k = 0 .. T-2     (T-1 scalars)
    a[j]        = d[j+1] - d[j]              j = 0 .. T-3     (T-2 scalars)
    score       = std(a), Bessel-corrected

Differencing the vectors and taking a std per dimension is a different
statistic, unvalidated by anybody, and it looks equally plausible in a diff.
`test_video_ai_check.py` pins this order against hand-computed values.

WHY XCLIP-B/16 AND NOT PLAIN CLIP, which would be simpler. The reference
measures ten encoders and reports that the CHOICE barely matters on clean
footage (CLIP-B/16 97.00 mAP against XCLIP-B/16's 97.72 on GenVideo). It stops
being true the moment the footage has been re-encoded, which for a scraped bank
is always: under JPEG requantisation at q60 CLIP-B/16 falls from 97.82 to 78.81
while XCLIP-B/16 goes 98.46 → 94.50 (their Table 6). The authors' own reading is
that second-order features are only as stable as the feature space under them.
Our corpus is re-encoded by construction, so that column decides it.

⚠️ XCLIP IS NOT A PER-FRAME ENCODER, which is a real property of this port and
not a detail. Every layer of `XCLIPVisionModel` passes a "message token" between
frames — `transformers` calls the block `CrossFrameAttentionBlock` — in groups of
exactly `config.num_frames` CONSECUTIVE items of the batch (8 for this
checkpoint). So a frame's vector depends on its neighbours, and:

  * the frame count MUST be a multiple of 8 or the reshape raises. That is why
    the reference hardcodes 8-or-16 and why FRAMES is fixed at 16 upstream.
  * several clips may share one forward pass ONLY while each contributes a
    multiple of 8 frames — otherwise a group would straddle two clips and mix
    one shot's motion into another's. `_encode` asserts it rather than trusting
    the caller; `test_batching_never_straddles_two_clips` pins it.

⚠️ AND THE TOWER MUST BE TAKEN OFF THE WHOLE MODEL, never loaded on its own. The
checkpoint stores its vision tensors under a `vision_model.` prefix, so the bare
`XCLIPVisionModel.from_pretrained(id)` matches nothing and hands back a RANDOM
encoder — silently, with plausible weight statistics and plausible-looking
scores. Measured, and guarded at load time; see `main`.

The preprocessing reproduces the reference EXACTLY, including one thing that is
plainly a bug: it reads frames with `cv2.imread` (BGR) and hands them to a
CLIP-family encoder trained on RGB, then normalises with ImageNet statistics
rather than CLIP's own. Both are wrong on their face.

THE FIX WAS MEASURED AND NOT TAKEN, which is the honest version of this comment.
On ten forged clips built here — five constant-velocity pans against five of the
same scenes at the same mean speed with per-frame jitter, sensor noise and
exposure flicker, all encoded to H.264 and read back through the real pass:

    BGR + ImageNet (the reference)   AUC 0.840   smooth 0.657 / handheld 0.866
    RGB + ImageNet                   AUC 0.840   smooth 0.607 / handheld 0.981
    RGB + CLIP's own statistics      AUC 0.640   smooth 0.729 / handheld 0.934

So "obviously wrong" is not obviously better: the colour swap changes nothing
here, and using CLIP's own statistics — the most defensible-looking of the three
— is the one that clearly hurts. Ten synthetic clips are not a validation set
either way. What IS on the other side of the scale is 40 subsets of real
generators, and the compression-robustness table this port was chosen for, all
measured on BGR. Deviating would keep the citation while dropping the only thing
the citation guarantees. So the port stays faithful, the measurement is written
down, and changing it is a one-line edit waiting on a labelled corpus this app
does not have. Pinned by a test so it cannot drift by accident.

⚠️ These numbers were taken with the encoder's weights VERIFIED as loaded (0
missing keys). Anyone re-running this must do the same: a randomly initialised
XCLIP still separates these two classes, so a comparison made without that check
measures the forgery and not the encoder.

Protocol (one JSON line in, one JSON line out — a batch, not a warm worker):
  stdin  : {"clips": [{"id": 12, "frames": ["<abs jpeg>", ...]}, ...],
            "model": "microsoft/xclip-base-patch16", "models_root": path|null}
  stdout : {"ok": true, "steps": {"12": [d0, ...]}, "clips": N, "device": "cpu"}
           {"ok": false, "error": "<ExcType>: <message>"}
  stderr : "[aicheck] …" progress lines; the parent does not parse them.

STEPS OUT, NOT A SCORE. The child returns the per-adjacent-pair distances and
stops there. Turning T-1 distances into one number per shot is a product
decision with an argument attached (see `video_ai_check.irregularity`), and it
belongs in the pure module a test can exercise without torch — the same split
`video_aesthetic_infer` makes with `video_metrics.aesthetic_of`.
