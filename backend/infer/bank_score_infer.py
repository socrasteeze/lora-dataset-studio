"""Bank scoring pass — CLIP ViT-L/14 aesthetic + NSFW classifier + style
embeddings, run in the DEDICATED "bank scoring" ML interpreter (torch/open_clip/
transformers are not in the Flask venv). Same subprocess family as
face_embed_infer.py; CUDA when available, else CPU.

One CLIP forward per image feeds THREE outputs, so a mixed dump can be triaged by
"nice vs ugly", "SFW vs NSFW" and "grouped by visual style" from a single pass:

  * aesthetic — the LAION improved-aesthetic MLP head on the (L2-normed) CLIP
    ViT-L/14 image embedding → ~1..10 (higher = nicer). The head weights download
    once from the public LAION repo and cache under `models_root` (or the HF cache).
  * nsfw      — Marqo/nsfw-image-detection-384 (a small self-contained timm/
    transformers classifier) → P(NSFW) in 0..1. A SEPARATE tiny model load, kept in
    the same subprocess so the pass stays one queued job.
  * style     — the CLIP image embedding itself (L2-normed), cached in the .npz and
    union-find clustered by cosine ≥ style_threshold, exactly like the face pass
    clusters by identity. Cluster ids are 1-based, biggest first.

Protocol (same shape as face_embed_infer.py):
  stdin  : {"images": [abs paths], "models_root": path|null,
            "cache": abs path to a .npz|null, "style_threshold": 0.6,
            "rescore": false}
  stdout : ONE JSON line {"ok": bool,
            "results": {path: {state, aesthetic?, nsfw?}},
            "clusters": {path: int}|null, "computed": int, "reused": int,
            "error"?: str}
  stderr : "[score] i/N <state>" progress lines the parent streams to the UI, and
           "[phase] <sentence>" lines for the steps that have no per-image
           counter (cache write, style grouping) — the parent shows those
           verbatim instead of leaving a full bar and a stale count behind.

Each of the three heads degrades independently: if the aesthetic weights can't be
fetched the pass still returns nsfw + style (aesthetic omitted), and vice-versa —
a broken single head never sinks the whole pass. Embeddings + scores are cached in
the .npz and written every CACHE_EVERY images, so killing the pass mid-way loses at
most that slice.

RESUMING is what the cache is for, and it has two halves:
  * a path already cached (and unchanged on disk) is never embedded again — that
    is the cheap half, and it is why the payload stays the WHOLE bank instead of
    "the unscored rows". The clustering below needs every embedding, so shrinking
    the payload would not save inference, it would only make the style partition
    wrong;
  * a path cached while a head was DOWN carries a hole (aesthetic or nsfw None)
    and state 'ok'. Those used to be cached forever: the entry existed, so the
    image was skipped, so the missing score never came back — a permanent gap
    from a transient download failure. They are now retried whenever the head
    that was missing is available again, and only then (a head that is still
    down leaves them exactly as they are, so no run ever churns).

``rescore: true`` ignores the cache entirely — the explicit "recompute everything"
lane (new model, thresholds you no longer trust). The normal pass never does this.

Style clustering is NOT near-instant: measured 7.6 s over 5 000 images and 181 s
over 23 000 (n² cosine + a Python pass over every pair above the threshold). It is
therefore skipped on the cancel path — a stopped pass has 15 s to answer before the
parent kills it, and spending three minutes there would throw away the scores it
was trying to save."""
