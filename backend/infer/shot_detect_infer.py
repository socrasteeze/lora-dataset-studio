"""TransNetV2 shot-boundary detection worker — the video lane's only consumer
of torch and `transnetv2-pytorch`.

WHY THIS WORKER DECODES ITSELF INSTEAD OF CALLING THE LIBRARY'S OWN
`predict_video()` / `detect_scenes()`. Those high-level methods shell out to an
`ffmpeg` COMMAND (via the `ffmpeg-python` wrapper the package depends on) and,
for their timestamps, separately call `ffmpeg.probe()` — which is `ffprobe`, a
second binary. Both assume a full ffmpeg toolchain sitting on PATH. This app
solved that exact problem once already, the hard way (see video_probe.py's
docstring on the video-bank branch): the bundled `imageio-ffmpeg` ships ffmpeg
WITHOUT ffprobe, so anything that shells out to either binary works on a
developer's machine — which has a full install on PATH — and breaks on
precisely the install the video extra exists for. So this worker decodes with
PyAV instead — already the video lane's chosen decode path — straight down to
the network's fixed 48x27 input geometry, and never touches the library's own
video/probe helpers. TransNetV2 itself is used only for what only it can do:
`predict_frames()` (windowed inference over an already-decoded frame tensor).
Its `predictions_to_scenes` transition rule is reimplemented below in plain
Python (a faithful port, not a rewrite) so it can be unit tested with no torch
import at all — the same discipline every seam in this file follows.

THE NETWORK IS NEVER THE BOTTLENECK, DECODING IS. TransNetV2 runs on 48x27
frames — a few KB each — so a decode-plus-resize is the entire per-frame cost
that matters here. This worker decodes each source video exactly ONCE: the
frames handed to the model are the same reformatted frames read from the
container in a single pass, never re-opened or re-scaled for a second purpose.

BOUNDARIES COMING OUT OF THIS FILE ARE STILL FRAME INDICES. Converting them to
PTS seconds is deliberately NOT this file's job: TransNetV2 reasons only in
indices of the frames it was handed, and scraped video is routinely
variable-frame-rate, where frame index n names no stable instant. That
conversion belongs to the parent (services/shot_detect.py), which has the
caller's measured `fps_native` — often already sitting on a VideoSource row
from an earlier probe. This worker still reports what IT measured from its own
decode pass (`fps_native` per video below), as the fallback the parent uses
when the caller has no cached value to hand it.

Weights ship INSIDE the `transnetv2-pytorch` wheel (~33 MB, MIT) — the
constructor below never downloads anything and works fully offline.

Protocol (same streaming shape as watermark_detect_infer.py — one line per
file, because a bank-wide pass must be able to report partial progress and
must not let one corrupt source cost the rest):
  stdin  : ONE json object
           {"videos": [abs paths], "threshold": 0.5, "device": "auto"|"cuda"|"cpu",
            "cancel_file": path|null}
  stdout : ONE json line PER VIDEO, in input order:
           {"path": str, "state": "ok"|"error",
            "shots": [[start_frame, end_frame], ...],
            "frame_count": int|null, "fps_native": float|null, "error": str|null}
           then a final line {"summary": {"ok": bool, "processed": int,
            "errors": int, "device": str, "error"?: str}}.
  stderr : "[shotdet] i/N state" progress lines + load diagnostics.

A per-file failure is a row with state "error", never a dead pass: one corrupt
video among four hundred must cost that video and not the scan.
