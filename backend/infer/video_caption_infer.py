"""Describe what HAPPENS in a shot — Qwen3-VL, as a warm worker.

The fourth model worker in this project and the first that reads TIME. ✨ Score
embeds one image, the CLIP towers encode one image or one phrase; this one is
handed a sequence of frames and asked what the movement is.

⛔ WHY NOT OLLAMA, pinned here because it is the mistake available for free.
Ollama fails SILENTLY on video on this machine: the request returns an EMPTY
response with no error, the fence swallowing everything (`text generate skipped`
in its logs). A captioner that returns "" and reports success fills a bank with
empty sidecars — and an empty sidecar is not a neutral default, ai-toolkit trains
it as an empty prompt and says nothing. So this lane talks to transformers
directly, where a failure is an exception.

VERIFIED ON THIS MACHINE BEFORE THIS FILE EXISTED — the video lane's absolute
rule, no unverified model claim:

    Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct   already in the HF cache, 8.3 GB, both shards
    ai-toolkit venv             python 3.12.9, transformers 5.5.3, torch 2.9.1+cu128
    Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration   exposed NATIVELY by that transformers
    Qwen3VLProcessor            accepts `videos=`, carries a chat template
    qwen_vl_utils               NOT installed

That last line is a design constraint, not a footnote. Every Qwen-VL example
imports `qwen_vl_utils` to sample a video; it is not here, and adding a
dependency to an environment we did not build is something this project refuses
to do (see scoring_python.py). It is also unnecessary: the PARENT already
extracts frames with PyAV for the embedding pass, so it samples them here too
and hands over a list of JPEG paths. The processor takes them as `videos=[[...]]`
with no helper at all.

NATIVE CLASS, NOT trust_remote_code. The lesson is recorded in
watermark_detect_infer.py: Florence-2 ships its modelling code in its repo,
written against an old transformers, and pinning the whole shared environment
back for one unmaintained remote file was the wrong price. Qwen3-VL is integrated
in transformers itself — no remote code, no version roulette.

Protocol — a WARM WORKER, because loading 8.3 GB costs far more than captioning
one shot, and the parent commits per clip so a stopped pass loses nothing:

  stdin,  once      : {"models_root": path|null, "device": "auto"|"cpu",
                       "max_new_tokens": 96}
  stdout, once ready: {"ok": true, "ready": true, "device": "cuda"}
  stdin,  per clip  : {"frames": ["abs.jpg", ...], "prompt": "..."}\n
  stdout, per clip  : {"ok": true, "caption": "..."}\n
                      {"ok": false, "error": "..."}\n   ← one bad clip, worker lives
  EOF on stdin      : clean exit.
A fatal load failure prints {"ok": false, "ready": false, "error": ...} and exits.

An EMPTY generation is reported as an error, never as a caption. That is the
Ollama failure mode defended against structurally rather than by trusting a
model to always speak.
