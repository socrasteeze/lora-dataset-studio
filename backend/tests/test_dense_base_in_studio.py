"""A quantized or merged full model must be selectable as a Test Studio base.

THE ONE LINE THAT HID IT
------------------------
``get_krea_models`` accepted a checkpoint only if its RELATIVE DIRECTORY carried
'krea' (or if it was literally the wired default at the root). The local fp8
quantize/merge tools write next to their source, which is often the ROOT of
ComfyUI's ``diffusion_models`` — that is where ComfyUI looks. So a file those
tools just produced was invisible to the one screen meant to try it.

The asymmetry proves it was an oversight rather than a rule: the Generate surface
(``krea_edit_helper._krea_unet_folders``) has always matched 'krea' in the folder
OR in the filename, root included. This aligns the Studio with that rule, which
retro-fits every twin already delivered without moving a byte.

WHAT COMES FREE ONCE IT IS LISTED: ``krea_build_of`` already reads ``_fp8`` as a
RAW build, and ``krea_model_defaults`` already answers with the training recipe's
own sample settings (CFG 4 / 25 steps). The base picker seeds its axes from those.
