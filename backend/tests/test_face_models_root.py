"""antelopev2 lands where the install can keep it.

Community report (Discord): "Person grouping keeps trying to download the
antelopev2 file every time I restart the container. Did I maybe forget to mount
a path in my docker config so it's persistent or could it be a bug? The rest of
the dependencies stays installed after reboots, seems to be just this one now."

Nothing was missing from their mounts. Face work was the only engine that never
placed its own weights: with no ``root=``, insightface writes ~350 MB under
``~/.insightface``. That home is permanent on a native install, which is why the
default survived this long unseen — and in Docker it sits in the container's
writable layer, which no Compose file mounts and which ``--force-recreate`` (how
the launcher starts a STOPPED container) discards. The ML venvs live under
``data/envs``, on the mounted volume: that is exactly why "the rest of the
dependencies stays installed" and this one alone did not.

Two things are pinned here. What the resolver answers — and the fact that every
face surface hands that answer to its child. There are four producers, across
both surfaces (the Bank's face pass, its folder sample check, the dataset
scorer, the mask detector); one that forgets is the whole bug back.
