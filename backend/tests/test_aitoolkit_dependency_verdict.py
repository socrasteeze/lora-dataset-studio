"""A venv that cannot train must not read as ready, and must be told what to run.

Two holes, both measured on the code these tests now pin, both reported by
acontentsheltie (Discord, RTX 3090):

1. The torch probe put `from accelerate import Accelerator` AND `Accelerator()`
   in one `try/except Exception: pass`. A venv with a working torch and no
   accelerate — or with an Accelerate config that raises — came back as
   `accelerator_device: null`, the verdict read the empty string as
   nothing-to-say, and the Test button went GREEN on an install that cannot
   train. ai-toolkit builds its Accelerator on the same bare call
   (`toolkit/accelerator.py`), so the probe failing IS the run failing.

2. Every `ModuleNotFoundError` was explained as an interpreter problem, under a
   headline hardcoded to "cannot import torch". For a missing `dotenv` the
   headline was false, the remedy (repoint the interpreter) was a dead end, and
   the one line that fixes it was never printed.

Pure units: no GPU, no ai-toolkit, no network. The only filesystem touched is a
tmp_path standing in for a checkout.
