"""🗃️ Image bank — what pressing Stop COSTS, published by whoever knows.

Reported from a live 36 925-image bank, mid ✨ Score:

    Scoring pass running — 2200 / 36925 · writing 36925 score(s) to the
    database… — a few minutes on a bank this size          [ Stop ]

    "the Stop button at that point works very badly."

Measured on that instance while the pass was writing: ``POST /cancel`` answered
in 79 ms (it touches no database — the job registry is in memory) while
``GET /api/bank/<id>``, the banner's own source, took 2 745 ms. The button was
never broken, it was MUTE, and the log holds seven cancel POSTs inside 20 ms.

The front end can make the button answer its own click. What it cannot do is
say what stopping costs, because that is not a property of the pass — it is a
property of the PHASE. ✨ Score stops three different ways inside one run:

    inference   → what the child computed is salvaged, the global style
                  partition is not (it is computed over the whole bank at once)
    write-back  → the flag is read once per commit batch, so the stop lands at
                  the end of the current 200 rows
    style write → the stop does not land at all, that step is written whole or
                  not at all

Only the worker knows which of those is true this second. These tests pin that
it says so, and that a phase with nothing specific to promise stays SILENT
rather than inventing a reassurance.
