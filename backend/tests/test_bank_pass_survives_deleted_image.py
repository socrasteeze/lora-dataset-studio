"""🗃️ Image bank — deleting an image mid-pass skips that image, never the pass.

A bank pass reads its rows, then walks them for minutes or hours, committing as
it goes. `expire_on_commit` is on, so every row it has not reached yet is a lazy
re-SELECT — and rows CAN disappear underneath it: `delete_bank` cancels the live
job *cooperatively* and then drops every bank_image row immediately, so the
still-running thread keeps iterating over rows that are already gone
(`delete_rejected` does the same if the registry has aged the pass out as stale).

SQLAlchemy's answer to that is fatal by default: plain attribute access on an
expired row whose database row is gone raises ObjectDeletedError, and so does a
commit carrying a write staged on one. Either killed the WHOLE pass — one image
deleted at the wrong moment threw away the analysis of every image already
walked, with `ObjectDeletedError: ...` as the only thing the user was told.

Each test below deletes ONE image from the middle of a pass, through that pass's
own inference hook (the point where the real deletion lands: the pass is inside a
model call, not between two rows), and pins the same three things:

    the pass finished without an error, the surviving images were written,
    and the end-of-pass line SAYS one image was skipped.

The last one is not decoration. A pass that silently swallowed the row would pass
the first two assertions while telling the user it analysed N images when it
analysed N-1.
