"""Stop that cannot lie + the out-of-monitor safety net.

Incident that motivated this file: a cloud run froze mid-run (its monitor
thread stopped making progress), the pod kept billing for hours, and the Stop
button answered {'ok': true} without terminating anything — request_stop only
set an in-process threading.Event that nobody was listening to any more.

Everything here is offline: vast_client is fully stubbed, no thread is
started, no dollar is spent.
