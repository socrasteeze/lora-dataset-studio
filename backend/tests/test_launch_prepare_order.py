"""A refused launch must not pay for the freeze it will never use.

`prepare_launch` hashes every image in the dataset, probes nvidia-smi and reads
the ai-toolkit revision. It deliberately runs OUTSIDE the queue/GPU-arbiter lock
pair (doing it under the lock is what once lost cloud runs to `database is
locked`), which means the authoritative "a training is already in progress" test
— which lives inside that pair — necessarily comes after it.

The cheap flag test at the top of `launch_training` covers the common case, but a
real dataset export sits between the two, and that takes minutes: long enough for
another launch to win the process slot. So the flag is re-read immediately before
the freeze. Two in-memory reads; the lock keeps the authority.

Asserted on the SOURCE because `launch_training` cannot be driven here without a
GPU, an ai-toolkit install and a real dataset export — and the property being
protected is an ORDER of statements, which is exactly what a rewrite silently
loses.
