"""Bounded concurrency for the vision passes (services/vision_pool.py).

The passes that call Ollama once per image over tens of thousands of files now
overlap those calls. Three properties make that safe, and each has a test here:
the pool never runs wider than configured, a cancel stops feeding it while
keeping every answer already paid for, and a single failing call is carried back
as a value instead of sinking the pass. No Ollama and no database involved —
this is the mechanism on its own.
