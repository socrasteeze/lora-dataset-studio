"""An ML capability install that does not actually work must not report success.

Reported by 1Tomber (GitHub #24) on Linux/Python 3.12: installing "Person masks"
from Setup ▸ Install/repair individually reported success — every requirement
"already satisfied" — while the capability stayed ✗ Not installed and masked
training silently degraded to unmasked. Three defects stacked:

  1. the masks install set omitted onnxruntime, which rembg ≥2.0.50 imports at
     load but no longer declares;
  2. the install reported success without ever re-checking the capability, so the
     app said one thing while knowing another — and the import traceback, which
     names the missing module, was thrown away;
  3. the resulting run trained unmasked with no pre-launch warning.

These tests pin all three, plus the constraint that the fix must not reinstall
onnxruntime on the very many machines that already have one — least of all
replace a user's onnxruntime-gpu with the CPU build.

No test here touches the real network or a real pip: every subprocess seam is
stubbed.
