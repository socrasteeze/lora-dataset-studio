"""WHO wrote a caption, said where the caption is READ — and counted when it matters.

`caption_origin` has been stamped by every caption writer since caption_origin.py
landed, and it was used for exactly ONE decision: which rows a forced re-caption
spares.  The screens where a caption is read still showed an anonymous string, and
the run reported "427 captioned" over two halves written by two different engines.

These tests measure the PROPERTY on each side of the wire:
  * the payloads really carry the stamp, per image and per field;
  * the pass's own result names the writers, counted from the rows it STAMPED —
    not from the pool it started with, and not from the backend it was asked for;
  * the launch window's NSFW figures divide by what ✨ Score measured, never by the
    pile (an image nobody scored is unknown, not clean).
