"""🗑 Deleting images from a checkpoint's gallery.

A checkpoint can accumulate dozens of test renders and most of them are misses;
until now the gallery could only show them. Deleting one is a REAL delete — the
row is the Test Studio's own cell, so it leaves both surfaces at once — which is
why every guarantee below is asserted rather than assumed:

  * the file leaves the dataset folder the RECOVERABLE way (OS trash → the app's
    own trash → a permanent unlink only when both refuse), and the mode is
    announced by the gallery BEFORE the click;
  * no orphan is left behind: neither a row whose file is gone, nor a
    ``checkpoint_preview`` pointer aimed at a deleted row;
  * an install that is not tidy — a file already missing, a cell still
    generating, two rows over one file, an id from another checkpoint — degrades
    with a reported reason instead of destroying the wrong thing.

Both disposal modes are exercised deterministically by injecting a fake / absent
``send2trash`` module (the real one would move test files to the OS recycle bin).
