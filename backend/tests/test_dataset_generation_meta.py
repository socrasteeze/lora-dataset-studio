"""⚙ generation_meta — the dataset's own "made with" stamp.

Three layers, cheapest proof first:

  * the helpers: what is stamped is exactly what was known (None dropped,
    nothing left -> NULL, bad JSON parses to None instead of crashing a
    viewer on a hand-edited database);
  * the SOURCE contract: every place that creates a PENDING GENERATED
    FaceDatasetImage stamps generation_meta in the same constructor call.
    This is the anti-forget guard: the gap being closed existed precisely
    because five lanes were written on five different days — a sixth lane
    added without a stamp must fail here BY NAME, not ship a new island of
    rows that know nothing about themselves;
  * one lane end-to-end (the Klein variations), enqueue mocked: the stamp
    round-trips through the column and the parser with the engine's facts.
