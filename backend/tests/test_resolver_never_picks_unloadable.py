"""A base-model resolver must never CHOOSE a file the loader cannot open.

Reported by naniii2352 (Discord) as "it generated half the images and then
started throwing a gguf error" — with no setting touched between the two. The
cause was not his config: `resolve_krea_unet` picks the first candidate whose
NAME contains 'turbo', and `krea2_turbo-Q4_K_M.gguf` contains 'turbo'. Dropping
that file into a krea folder mid-session was enough for the app to start
choosing, on its own, a model core ComfyUI never even scans — which is why
copying it into every models directory changed nothing.

The listing side deliberately still shows .gguf (a file you can see is a
nameable problem; a file that silently vanished is not). The CHOOSING side must
not. These tests pin that difference, because it is the kind of distinction that
gets flattened by the next person who unifies two extension tuples.
