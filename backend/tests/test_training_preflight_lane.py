"""The preflight lane: which warnings belong to a run that executes ELSEWHERE.

A cloud launch spends real money, and until now it opened no preflight at all —
the blockers still applied (cloud_training calls assert_trainable), but the whole
WARNING tier and its fix-in-place modal were skipped: leaking captions,
near-duplicates, untriaged images silently left out of the paid run.

Turning it on wholesale would have been worse than useless, though. Two of the
eleven rows read THIS machine — its GPU memory, its ai-toolkit torch build — and
on a cloud-only install (no local training environment at all) they would fire on
every single launch. A warning that cries wolf destroys the credibility of the
ten that don't, so `lane='cloud'` drops them, rows AND warning lines.

The inverse trap is face_mask: it too is a read of the local install, but the
masks are GENERATED locally at export and uploaded with the images — missing
InsightFace here means the PAID run trains unmasked. Local origin, cloud
consequence: it stays.
