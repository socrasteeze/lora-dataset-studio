"""◉ Canvas — the BASE MODEL is an axis, like it already is in the Test Studio.

The board's panel offers « BASE MODEL (MULTI) » and lets several bases be
ticked, but the launch only ever ran ONE of them: the canvas sent
`zModels[0]` and `create_comparison_run` pinned a single `z_model` before it
built its matrix. Three bases ticked therefore produced one generation, and
nothing said the other two had been dropped — the worst shape a limit can take,
because the run LOOKS like the one that was asked for.

`create_run` (one dataset, the Test Studio) has always swept a `z_models` list.
This pins the same contract on the comparison engine the canvas drives, plus
the two properties a sweep gets wrong in silence:

  · ADDITIVITY — a caller that only knows `z_model` produces exactly the run it
    always produced. Every existing surface and every older frontend keeps
    working, which is what makes this safe to land in a shared engine;
  · the PRODUCT — N bases × the cells = N × the cells, in ONE run, each row
    carrying the base it was actually generated with. A sweep that mislabels
    its rows is worse than no sweep: the images all arrive, all look
    plausible, and the comparison they were fired for is a lie.
