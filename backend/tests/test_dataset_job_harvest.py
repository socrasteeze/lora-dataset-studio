WHAT HAPPENED (reported by the maintainer from a real run, 2026-08-02)
---------------------------------------------------------------
SeedVR2 rendered perfectly. ComfyUI reported `execution_success`, the queue row
went `completed` with `result_filename` set, and the 2.2 MB PNG sat in ComfyUI's
output folder. The dataset candidate row stayed `status='pending'` with
`filename` NULL, so the workspace showed nothing at all and the log was clean —
because nothing had failed.

Cause: `_dispatch_completion` routes a dataset job by testing
`model_name in DATASET_IMAGE_JOB_NAMES`, and `seedvr2_upscale` was not in that
set. The `elif` chain simply fell through. No branch, no exception, no log.

THIS IS THE SECOND TIME. Krea 2 Edit shipped with exactly this bug (twelve
images generated and stranded, panel stuck at 0/12). The guard written then —
`test_the_declared_set_matches_what_the_engines_actually_stamp` — promises in its
own docstring that "a third engine added to the enqueue side without being added
here fails here". It does not: it iterates a HARDCODED tuple of two helper
modules, so a third helper module is invisible to it. It could only ever catch a
name declared in the set but stamped by nobody — the opposite direction from the
one that breaks twice.

So this file guards the direction that actually fails: it DISCOVERS the engines
instead of listing them.
