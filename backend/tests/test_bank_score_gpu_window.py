"""🗃️ Image bank — ✨ Score only holds the GPU when it actually uses it.

The scoring extra installs CPU-only torch on purpose, and the child picks its
own device (`cuda if torch.cuda.is_available()`). The parent used to take the
GPU-exclusive window regardless — so on a CPU install the pass unloaded ComfyUI
and blocked every training start for the whole run (measured at ~57 min on a
9 000-image bank) while computing on the CPU anyway. The face pass had the right
shape all along; these tests pin the same contract onto Score.
