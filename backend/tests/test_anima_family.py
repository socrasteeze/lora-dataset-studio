"""Anima ('anima') — a first-class training family (circlestone-labs Anima, a
Cosmos Predict2 DiT 2B + Qwen3 text encoder + T5 conditioner + Qwen-Image VAE).

What matters here: the family is accepted end-to-end, the extension-arch guard
refuses a launch on an ai-toolkit that lacks the 'anima' arch (silent SD-loader
fallback otherwise, PR ostris/ai-toolkit #860), the job-config mirrors ai-toolkit
options.ts (arch 'anima', PUBLIC base, quantize off, weighted timesteps, the anime
default negative, rank 32), the official base is PUBLIC (no gate), deploy routing
lands in loras/anima, and — crucially for THIS wave — the cloud path is REFUSED
(local-first until the pod image ships a recent ai-toolkit + diffusers).
