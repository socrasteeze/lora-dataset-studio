"""🎛 Steps (and CFG) are settable with SEVERAL LoRAs selected — compare AND blend.

User report: "I cannot set the number of steps when I have two LoRAs selected, in
blend or in comparison mode."

The field was not disabled and it was not overwritten: it was ABSENT. The
multi-LoRA branch of the Test Studio (`ComparisonStudio` → `StudioRunSetup`) had
no CFG/steps picker at all, because those ladders reach the single-LoRA studio and
the canvas panel through a per-DATASET payload the comparison has no dataset for.
Its launch body therefore never carried `steps`, and every cell fell back to the
family default.

The route and the engine were already able to do it — which is what makes the fix
a front-end one plus one additive field on `/api/studio/base-models`. What is
pinned here is the half that can regress silently:

  · the ladders are published without a dataset, and are the SAME constants the
    dataset payload sends (two ladders would be two answers to one question);
  · non-default steps really reach the WORKFLOW SUBMITTED to ComfyUI, in
    comparison AND in blend — asserted on the graph captured at the queue's door,
    not on the arguments handed to a mock;
  · the value is persisted on the cell, so a resume replays the run that was
    launched rather than the default one.
