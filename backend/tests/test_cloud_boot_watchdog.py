"""Boot watchdog: the structural twin of the first-step watchdog (2026-07-28).

The boot wait already READ the pod's remote state — vast status, port
publication — and spent it on the phase line only, then decided on elapsed time
alone. A host honestly pulling a 26 GB container image was killed at 25 minutes
and blacklisted for three days, invisibly, while the evidence that it was
working sat one line above the kill.

Same rule as the first-step watchdog: a pod whose remote evidence advances is a
pod that progresses. Same shape too — an idle clock rearmed by evidence, an
absolute ceiling evaluated BEFORE the rearm, and a failure message that says
what was MEASURED.
