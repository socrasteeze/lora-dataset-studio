"""Face SIMILARITY scoring is off for `anime` datasets — and says why.

InsightFace/antelopev2 is a detector+embedder trained on PHOTOGRAPHED faces. On a
drawn character it mostly detects nothing, and when it does the cosine it returns
is meaningless. Before this gate the pass still ran and failed OPEN: grey "no face
detected" tiles everywhere, or worse a plausible-looking number, with nothing on
screen saying the tool simply cannot read this kind of image.

What this file locks:
  1. ONE decision point (`face_scoring_block_reason`) that every scoring entry
     point consults, so the rule can never diverge across the three lanes.
  2. The three lanes actually refuse: the dataset pass, the Studio cell scoring,
     and best-epoch selection — each returning the REASON in its own shape.
  3. Strict non-regression for `human` (and every other subject type): the pass
     runs exactly as before.
  4. The gate is scoped to InsightFace ONLY. `face_crop_to_square_webp` /
     `detect_head_bbox` go through Qwen3-VL, a general vision model that reads a
     drawn head fine — head-cropping an anime reference must keep working. Gating
     it "by analogy" would have broken a feature that was never broken.
  5. Nothing is destroyed: face_score/face_state rows written before the dataset
     was marked anime survive the gate untouched (flip the subject type back to
     Human and they are all still there).
