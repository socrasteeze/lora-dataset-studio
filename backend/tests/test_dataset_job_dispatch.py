"""Every local generation engine must link its finished image back to its row.

Regression test for a failure that produced NO error at all: Krea 2 Edit shipped
stamping `krea_identity_edit_dataset` on its jobs while `_dispatch_completion`
still matched only Klein's `klein_edit_dataset`. ComfyUI rendered the images, the
queue marked the jobs completed, and the dataset rows stayed `pending` with a
NULL filename — the panel read "0/12" forever and the logs were clean, because
nothing had failed.

It then happened AGAIN with SeedVR2, identically. This file covers the routing
itself, engine by engine; the guard that catches the next unregistered engine
lives in `test_dataset_job_harvest.py`, which discovers them instead of listing
them, and so does the repair of rows a miss has already stranded.

# The set-vs-engines check used to live here, and it did not work. It iterated a
# HARDCODED tuple `(klein_edit_helper, krea_edit_helper)`, so it could only ever
# notice a name declared in the set but stamped by nobody. A THIRD helper module
# was invisible to it — which is precisely how SeedVR2 shipped stranding its
# results months after Krea did the same. Its docstring claimed it would catch
# "a third engine added to the enqueue side"; it could not, and that false
# promise is worse than no test.
#
# It now lives in test_dataset_job_harvest.py, where it DISCOVERS the engines by
# walking app/services with the AST instead of naming them. Both directions are
# covered there. Do not reintroduce a version of it that hardcodes a module list.
