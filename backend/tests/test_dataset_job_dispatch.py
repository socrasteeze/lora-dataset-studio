"""Every local generation engine must link its finished image back to its row.

Regression test for a failure that produced NO error at all: Krea 2 Edit shipped
stamping `krea_identity_edit_dataset` on its jobs while `_dispatch_completion`
still matched only Klein's `klein_edit_dataset`. ComfyUI rendered the images, the
queue marked the jobs completed, and the dataset rows stayed `pending` with a
NULL filename — the panel read "0/12" forever and the logs were clean, because
nothing had failed.

The test walks `DATASET_IMAGE_JOB_NAMES` instead of naming engines one by one,
so a third engine added to the enqueue side without being added here fails here.
