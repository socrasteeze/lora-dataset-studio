"""🎬 What a promotion is MADE OF — composition reporting and the per-source cap.

The hole this closes was found by our own end-to-end test: it promoted "the first
50 clips that pass the filters", which meant "in id order", which meant
concentrated on the first few sources. Nothing limited one source's share of a
dataset, so a 50-clip dataset could quietly be 3 videos over-represented — the
kind of imbalance that overfits a source and that nobody sees, because the folder
looks exactly like a diverse one.

Two answers, both at promotion time:
  * the result REPORTS composition (sources, the biggest source's share), so the
    imbalance is at least visible;
  * an optional `max_per_source` cap spreads the selection, keeping the earliest
    clips of each source (earliest = detector order, stable and explainable).

# honoured by the service and passed by neither the route nor the dialog, so the
# cap existed only in this file. A parameter no caller can send is not a feature,
# and it is the same shape of gap as `first_frame_floor` (a threshold the backend
# honoured and no reader named). These pin the whole path instead of the service.
