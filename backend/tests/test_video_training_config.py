"""The video branch of the ai-toolkit config generator, and the checkpoint
harvest that has to survive what a Wan 2.2 MoE writes to disk.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHAT IT IS ANCHORED TO
-------------------------------------------------------
An end-to-end smoke run has been through this: a dataset built by the video Bank
was handed to a local ai-toolkit and trained to decreasing loss. Every non-obvious
value asserted below is a value that run carried, not a value that looked sensible
in review. Where a number has no such provenance, the code refuses instead of
guessing, and there is a test for the refusal.

These tests are PURE — no ffmpeg, no PyAV, no torch, no GPU. The config generator
is arithmetic over a catalogue row and a database row, and the harvest is string
work over filenames, so both stay green on an install with none of the video
extras. That is a deliberate constraint on the code, not a convenience here.

THE TWO CLAIMS UNDER TEST
-------------------------
1. The emitted config says what the dataset actually contains. The clips on disk
   were encoded at one frame count and one size; a config that disagrees does not
   fail — ai-toolkit's sampler evenly spreads whatever it is asked for across the
   whole clip and reports nothing, so a wrong `num_frames` is a silent time-warp.
2. A Wan 2.2 14B checkpoint is TWO files. `save_lora` splits the state dict on
   `.transformer_1.` / `.transformer_2.` and writes `<name>_high_noise.safetensors`
   and `<name>_low_noise.safetensors`, because `split_multistage_loras` defaults to
   True. Every step number in this app was parsed by a regex anchored on
   `_<digits>.safetensors$` — an anchor those names break.
