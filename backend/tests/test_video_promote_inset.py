"""✂ Trimming the edges of every shot at promotion.

A shot boundary is where a cut just happened, so the frames immediately around it
are disproportionately dissolves, fades and leftovers of a transition. The
embedding pass already refuses to look at them (`video_clip_search.EDGE_MARGIN_S`
= 0.25 s), and the reason applies far more strongly to what actually gets
TRAINED on: a dataset whose clips all open on half a dissolve teaches the model
to open on half a dissolve.

So a promotion can inset both bounds. Three decisions carry it:

DEFAULT ZERO, ALWAYS. Turning this on by default would silently change what every
existing recipe exports — the same folder, the same name, different content, with
nothing to say so. It is asked for per promotion.

AN INSET NEVER SHORTENS A CLIP. The target's VAE takes a frame COUNT (4n+1 for
Wan, 8n+1 for LTX, 17n+5 for H3 — see video_targets.py), and `ClipTooShort`
exists because ffmpeg happily writes a 32-frame file and exits 0 when asked for
81 (video_clip_export.py:56-64). An inset that eats into the margin must
therefore DROP the clip, never export a short one — ai-toolkit would train it as
repeated stills without a word.

AND IT SAYS WHICH CLIPS IT COST. "Too short for 81 frames" and "too short ONCE
0.25 s was trimmed off each end" are the same sentence to a user and two
different problems: the first is a clip that was never usable, the second is one
the user's own setting removed, and only the second is fixed by lowering the
inset. Counting them together is how a setting quietly halves a dataset.
