"""The shipped workflows must run on a VANILLA ComfyUI.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-07-27)
---------------------------------
Reported by IndependentProcess0 (Reddit): generating variations died on his
install with a ComfyUI console error he had to go and find himself —

    Value not in list: scheduler: 'beta57' not in ['simple', 'sgm_uniform',
    'karras', 'exponential', 'ddim_uniform', 'beta', 'normal',
    'linear_quadratic', 'kl_optimal']

— while plain Klein generation in ComfyUI worked fine for him.

His ComfyUI was not old. It was NORMAL. The list he pasted is character-for-
character the core scheduler list (`comfy/samplers.py`, SCHEDULER_HANDLERS).
`beta57` has never been part of ComfyUI: it is added by the third-party node pack
RES4LYF, which monkey-patches the CORE enumeration at import time —

    RES4LYF/__init__.py
        SCHEDULER_HANDLERS["beta57"] = SchedulerHandler(
            handler=partial(comfy.samplers.beta_scheduler, alpha=0.5, beta=0.7))
        SCHEDULER_NAMES.append("beta57")

— so on a machine carrying that pack, even a plain core KSampler accepts
`beta57`. `improve skin.json` and `klein_inpaint.json` were captured on such a
machine and the value was frozen into them. Every user WITHOUT RES4LYF — most of
them — could not generate at all, and nothing in the graph hinted at a dependency:
not one third-party node appears in it.

THAT is the trap this file exists to catch. A node pack that extends a standard
enumeration makes a graph non-portable with NO visible third-party node, so the
usual "are all the node classes present?" preflight passes and the user finds out
at their first generation.

Both files now use `scheduler: "simple"`, which every ComfyUI has. It was picked
by alignment, not taste: four other shipped graphs already use `simple`
(ZImage_bigLove_ZT3_optimal, krea2_turbo, krea2_turbo_img2img, and the Krea graph
built in krea_edit_helper), and both Klein graphs already sampled with `euler`.
This DOES change how Klein images render compared to the old `beta57` — a
deliberate, one-time, everyone-at-once change, which is the point: one render
path for every install, not a per-user approximation.

WHY A STATIC TEST AND NOT ONLY THE RUNTIME CHECK
------------------------------------------------
There is also a runtime check (utils.comfyui.unsupported_enum_values) that turns
ComfyUI's raw 400 into a readable sentence. It is a good net but it is the LAST
one: it only fires on a user's machine, after shipping. This test fires on the
author's machine, offline, with no ComfyUI running — at the moment someone pastes
a workflow exported from an equipped install, which is exactly how the bug got in.
Cheap, deterministic, and it names the fix in its own failure message.

The reference lists below are transcribed from ComfyUI v0.28.3 (`comfy/samplers.py`
SCHEDULER_HANDLERS / SAMPLER_NAMES). They are the FLOOR, not the ceiling: they are
deliberately the values available on a plain install, so a value that is core but
very recent still gets a human look before it ships.
