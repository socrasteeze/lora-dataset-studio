"""Blacklisting a bad vast.ai host by machine_id alone does not hold.

Measured on 2026-07-28: run #120 failed on one machine_id and the host was
blacklisted. Run #121 was rented three minutes later on a DIFFERENT machine_id
— at the same public address. A vast machine_id is a file on the host
(/var/lib/vastai_kaalia/machine_id); reinstalling the daemon mints a new one on
the same physical box, so the ban was walked around without anyone trying.

The address is a WEAKER identity than the machine id — several machines can sit
behind one NAT — so it may only widen a ban a real failure already justified,
and it may never be the reason a launch finds nothing. Both properties are
tested here. Offline: no offer search, no rental, no network.
