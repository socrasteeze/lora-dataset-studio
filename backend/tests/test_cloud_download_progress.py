"""The two things a run card could not tell you about a pod that is costing money.

1. "Is it downloading or is it frozen?" — while a run pulls its base weights
   (26 GB) the card showed a single fixed sentence for as long as it took. The
   pod's log carried a byte counter the whole time and it was thrown away.
2. "Has it been quiet long enough to kill?" — the silence counter was measured
   from updated_at, which is re-stamped when the app re-adopts a run after a
   restart AND on every monitor poll. On a machine that restarts often the
   45-minute freeze watchdog could never be reached.

Everything here is offline: no pod, no network, no thread.
