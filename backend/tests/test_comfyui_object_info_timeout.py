"""The /object_info read budget, and telling a SLOW ComfyUI from a STOPPED one.

Reported and diagnosed by j_o_e_l. (Discord, #bug-reports): Krea 2 generations
refused with "ComfyUI isn't running" on a ComfyUI that was running. He timed the
`/object_info` enumeration on his own install at ~15 s against a hardcoded 8 s
budget, raised the four probe timeouts, and the engine worked again.

Two defects, both pinned here:

  1. 8 s was a GUESS that cannot hold. The /object_info payload lists every node
     class and every model file, so it grows with what the user has installed —
     the budget therefore has to be a setting, and its default has to have real
     margin over a measured install rather than 1.6x a lucky one.
  2. A timeout was REPORTED as "not running". Two causes, two remedies: start it
     vs give it more time. Nothing here asserts exact prose (it will be reworded);
     it asserts that the two messages are DIFFERENT, that the slow one names the
     delay, and that neither claims the wrong thing.

No real network anywhere: `requests.get` is replaced by a fake that reads the
budget it was handed and decides.
