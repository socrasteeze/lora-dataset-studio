"""Deleting a run AND everything it produced — the explicit cascade.

Removing a run used to mean ONE thing: tidying a ghost out of the graph. A run
whose checkpoints were still on disk was refused (409, "delete those first") and
generated images were only unlinked. That is still the default and this suite
guards it — but it is no longer the only mode: `?cascade=1` is the "delete
everything" a user asks for from the run panel.

The contracts held here are the ones that would hurt if they broke:

  * the cascade REALLY takes the weights (the assertion that fails on the old
    code: same run, conservative delete = 409 and files intact, cascade = 200 and
    the run dir empty);
  * the CONSERVATIVE mode is byte-for-byte what it was — no caller starts
    shredding files because a keyword gained a default. This is the most
    important anti-regression test of the pass;
  * children that resumed from the run SURVIVE, keep their own checkpoints and
    stay usable (detached, re-rooted — never deleted with their parent);
  * a dataset that is training right now is REFUSED before anything is touched;
  * a rated-good image and a LoRA already deployed into ComfyUI are KEPT — destroying
    something the user explicitly kept is worse than leaving an orphan;
  * a file that cannot be moved yields a PARTIAL (409) that keeps the run row, so
    the remaining weights stay reachable from the card that owns them;
  * the FK children are flushed BEFORE the parent row (this repo's "delete 500"
    trap), asserted with foreign_keys ON so a missing flush order is fatal here
    instead of silent.

Nothing touches a real install: every path is a pytest tmp dir and the
checkpoint scan is pointed at it."""
