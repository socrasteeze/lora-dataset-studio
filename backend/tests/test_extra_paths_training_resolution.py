"""The last two READ paths that ignored extra_model_paths.yaml.

Deploying a LoRA already follows the yaml (issue #25). Reading a BASE did not, in
two places, and each one broke a feature outright:

  * `lora_training._sdxl_base_path` walked ONLY <base>/models/checkpoints, then
    fell back to returning the bare name. An SDXL base declared in the yaml was
    handed to ai-toolkit as `bigLove_photo5.safetensors` — a relative path against
    ai-toolkit's own cwd — and the run died there, with ai-toolkit's message, about
    ai-toolkit's directory. Nothing pointed at the real cause.
  * `zimage_convert._resolve_merge` looked ONLY under <base>/models/{unet,
    diffusion_models}. A Z-Image merge under a yaml root was simply not convertible.

Every test here fails on the pre-fix code except the two `_without_yaml_` ones,
which are the anti-regression pins: with no yaml, resolution must be byte-for-byte
what it always was.

Casing: the on-disk spelling deliberately DIFFERS from the requested spelling, so
the case-insensitive guarantee is actually exercised on a case-SENSITIVE
filesystem (Linux/cloud), not just tautologically satisfied by Windows.
