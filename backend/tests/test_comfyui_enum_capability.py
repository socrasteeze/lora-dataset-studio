"""A graph that pins a widget value the user's ComfyUI doesn't have.

Reported by IndependentProcess0 (Reddit): variations died with a raw ComfyUI
console error — `Value not in list: scheduler: 'beta57' not in [...]` — on an
install where plain Klein generation works fine. The shipped 'improve skin.json'
and 'klein_inpaint.json' pin `"scheduler": "beta57"`, and nothing in the app ever
checked whether the target ComfyUI accepts it.

`beta57` is NOT a newer core scheduler: core ComfyUI has never shipped it. The
RES4LYF node pack appends it to comfy.samplers.SCHEDULER_HANDLERS at import, so a
CORE KSampler accepts it only on an install that loaded that pack — which is why
it works for whoever authored the graph and for nobody else.

The app detects the gap and stops with an actionable sentence. It does NOT swap in
a near-equivalent scheduler: that would change the render, leaving two populations
of users producing different images from identical settings.

No network, no generation: /object_info is a fixture.
