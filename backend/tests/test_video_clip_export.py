"""🎬 Turning a pair of timestamps into one training clip on disk.

Every test here is about a way the export could go wrong QUIETLY. A clip two
frames short, encoded at the source's frame rate, stream-copied from the nearest
keyframe, or missing its caption file does not raise anything — it trains, and it
trains badly. Several of these are documented behaviours of real trainers:

  * musubi-tuner CRASHES on a missing sidecar (FileNotFoundError, no try/except
    on the path); diffusion-pipe DROPS the clip instead, because its
    skip_empty_caption defaults to true.
  * diffusion-pipe and finetrainers read captions with a bare open(), i.e. the
    host's locale encoding. A BOM or a cp1252 byte is mojibake or a crash.
  * ai-toolkit never drops a too-short clip and never warns: it clamps and
    repeats frames, so a 5-frame clip trains as repeated stills.

So the guarantees are pinned as argument-level assertions rather than trusted to
a review of the ffmpeg line. No ffmpeg binary is invoked: this is the builder.
