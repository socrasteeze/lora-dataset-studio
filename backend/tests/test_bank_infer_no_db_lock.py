"""🗃️ Image bank — an inference pass holds NO database transaction while it waits.

Two shapes of wait live here: a child process (face, score) and a long series of
Ollama calls (watermark). The invariant is the same for both, and so is the
failure it prevents.

The face and score passes read their rows, hand a path list to a child process,
and only write results back when the child returns. That wait is not short: the
scoring extra ships CPU-only torch on purpose and a big bank measures near an
hour. Keeping the session's transaction open across it is a loaded gun — WAL
gives concurrent readers, never concurrent WRITERS, so one write joining that
transaction ahead of the child takes the single write lock for the whole pass
and every other writer dies on `database is locked` past the 5 s busy_timeout.
Two paid cloud runs were already abandoned that way on 2026-07-26 by a holder
that lasted five seconds.

These tests pin the invariant rather than the symptom: while the pass sits in
the subprocess, another connection to the same database must be able to write.
They need a FILE database (the shared `app` fixture's `:memory:` one cannot be
opened twice) and keep the app's real journal mode, so the lock they measure is
the lock a real install has.
