"""🗃️ Image bank — the QUALITY SCAN lets the rest of the app work while it runs.

`test_bank_infer_no_db_lock.py` pins this invariant for the score, face and
watermark passes. There was no equivalent for the scan, and the scan is the pass
the owner reported as "Scan quality freezes LDS, I can't get to anything during
the scan". Two different holders were measured behind that one sentence, so there
are two halves here and they fail for different reasons:

  • THE WALK. Re-reading each row goes through `Session.get`, and SQLAlchemy
    flushes before a SELECT. That flush took the single write lock at the first
    image after a mutation and held it until the commit 25 images later, so
    every other WRITER queued behind it: a sort click went from 5.0 ms median to
    327.6 ms (p90 2 183 ms, worst 5 564 ms, one HTTP 500 out of 62 clicks).

  • THE TAIL. `rebuild_dup_groups` wrote a global clear plus one UPDATE per group
    — about 5 000 of them on a 50 000-image bank — inside ONE transaction, held 6
    to 9.5 s. Past SQLite's 5 s busy_timeout that is not slowness, it is
    `database is locked` for everybody else (3 attempts out of 3).

These tests measure the PROPERTY, not its supposed causes: another connection
writes to the same database while the pass runs, and either it gets through or it
does not. A version that batches its commits but still parks the lock somewhere
else fails here, which is the whole point — "it commits in batches now" is a
statement about the code, "the app still answers" is a statement about the app.
Each half is paired with a test that reproduces the OLD holder on the same
fixture and shows the probe catching it, so a green run can never mean the probe
was simply looking the wrong way.
