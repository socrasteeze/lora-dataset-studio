"""infer/_harness.py stays a stdlib-only sibling, and the factored map holds.

The infer scripts run in their own torch venvs and are launched as plain files,
so their one shared module must import nothing a bare interpreter lacks — a
single torch/numpy/app import in _harness would kill every worker at startup.
And each script that handed a helper to the harness must keep importing it
rather than quietly growing a local copy back (the drift this factoring
removed). Pure AST checks: nothing here needs the ML venvs.

DIVERGENCE 5 — `_emit` is factored upstream but NOT here, for every script that
prints a result. This fork claims the real stdout for the result line
(`infer_io.claim_result_stream`, `tests/test_infer_result_channel.py`), so a
worker's `_emit` must print `file=_OUT`, never `_harness`'s plain
`print(..., flush=True)` — importing the shared one would send the result line
to the same stream `claim_result_stream` redirected library banners to, and the
parent would read `{}` back. Every FACTORED entry below is upstream's, minus
`_emit`; `_harness._emit` itself stays defined (upstream owns it, and this file
is otherwise adopted verbatim) but no script here may import it — which is what
the harness-level test below pins.

The map must also COVER every importer (upstream's own
test_factored_map_covers_every_importer, adopted 2026-08-28): a curated view
can miss a file, and `text_fill_infer.py` had been missing from it since it
shipped — which is precisely how it kept importing `_harness._emit` against
the rule above without anything failing."""
