"""A reference edit that is READY must survive a server restart.

This is the most expensive thing the app can lose. The edit is a LOCAL ComfyUI
job of one to three minutes; when it lands, its image is written into the
dataset folder and the registry entry that knows the image exists is held in
process memory. A restart dropped that entry, so the modal came back empty, Keep
answered 409, and the TTL sweep deleted the result thirty minutes later. An
hour of GPU time, for a picture no code path could ever show them again.

What is recovered, and what is not
----------------------------------
Only a candidate that had actually LANDED. An engine still running when the
process died produced nothing retrievable — its ComfyUI job is gone with the
thread — so it comes back FAILED, saying why, rather than running. A resurrected
"running" would be a spinner nothing is driving, and Discard would be the only
way out of a modal that promises a result that is never coming.

The trap this file exists to pin
--------------------------------
CANDIDATE_MARKER is in the name of two different kinds of file: the finished RESULT,
and the staged INPUT snapshots a local engine reads (`snapshot_…`, `modalref_…`).
Recovering by filename pattern would offer the user their own input photo back as
an edit result. So recovery is driven by a sidecar written when a candidate turns
ready — a file that only ever exists for a real result — and never by the name.

Freshness stays ONE rule, not two: recovery honours the same `_TTL_SECONDS` the
in-process purge and the disk sweep already use. A restart must not extend the
life of an abandoned edit beyond what staying up would have allowed.
