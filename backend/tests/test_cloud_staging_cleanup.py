"""Per-run staging cleanup on the Runs hub: sizes, the targeted 🧹, the sparing
rule both purges must share — and, above all, WHAT the cleanup is allowed to
throw away.

The hub used to offer ONE all-or-nothing "Clean finished runs" and no way to see
what a run weighed, so a 45-run / 60 GB history could only be cleaned blind.

Then the cleanup itself turned out to be dangerous: it trashed the whole staging
directory while advertising "checkpoint duplicates already imported". A
checkpoint that had never been deployed to ComfyUI had no duplicate — staging
was its only copy — and emptying the trash destroyed it. So the load-bearing
tests here are the ones that pin what SURVIVES a purge, not what it frees.
