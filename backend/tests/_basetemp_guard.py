"""Refuse to let two live pytest runs share one ``--basetemp``.

pytest DELETES an explicitly given ``--basetemp`` at startup: see
``_pytest/tmpdir.py``, ``TempPathFactory.getbasetemp`` — ``if basetemp.exists():
rm_rf(basetemp)``. Two runs pointed at the same path therefore destroy each
other's temporary trees mid-flight, and neither of them says so:

* the run that started FIRST loses, without warning, the files its tests are
  still using — the real git repositories of ``test_updater_history_rewrite``,
  the dataset folders of the preflight tests — and fails on an assertion that
  reads one of them back;
* the run that started SECOND dies with ``ERROR at setup`` on every single
  ``tmp_path`` fixture, because the directory it is busy deleting is held open
  by the first.

Both failures are intermittent (they need the two runs to overlap), independent
of test order, and green in isolation — which is exactly the shape everyone
reads as "flake". Measured on 2026-07-28: two suites sharing one ``--basetemp``
produced 1 phantom failure in ``test_updater_history_rewrite.py`` and 6 phantom
setup ERRORs in ``test_aitoolkit_remote.py``, none of which pointed at anything
wrong with the code or the tests.

So the collision is refused up front, loudly, naming the other run — a suite
that cannot run correctly must say so instead of producing archaeology.

The claim file is a SIBLING of the basetemp, never a child: pytest's own
``rm_rf`` of the basetemp would otherwise delete the very marker guarding it.
