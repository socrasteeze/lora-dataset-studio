"""🔎 Hybrid search — CLIP finds what is VISIBLE, captions find what HAPPENS.

The two halves answer different questions and neither replaces the other. CLIP
embeds frames, so it ranks by what a moment looks like; it cannot find "turns and
walks away", because that is a fact about time and no frame carries it. A caption
carries it and nothing else — it is a literal string, so it misses everything the
writer did not name.

HOW THEY ARE COMBINED, AND THE ONE NUMBER IN IT THAT IS NOT MEASURED.
The blend is `clip_similarity + w · caption_hit · spread`, where `caption_hit` is
the share of the query's words present in the caption and `spread` is THIS pool's
own gap between its best CLIP score and its median for THIS query.

That last factor is the point. CLIP cosines live in a narrow, per-bank band
(0.09-0.23 measured on this checkpoint), while a caption hit is 0..1. Adding them
raw would make any literal match outrank every visual one by a factor of five —
not a blend, a caption filter wearing a blend's clothes. Scaling the caption term
by the ranking's OWN spread makes the two commensurable without inventing a
conversion constant, which is the same reasoning that put `pool_median` in the
CLIP-only path.

`w` = 0.6 is INHERITED BY ANALOGY, not measured for this blend — the 0.6 that was
measured (image_bank_service.PUSH_DOWN_WEIGHT_DEFAULT, 7 316 images) is the
weight of a SUBTRACTED excluded phrase, a different experiment. It is a named,
tunable constant and it is reported to the caller so the UI never presents it as
a calibrated figure. This is stated here rather than in a commit message because
it is the one claim in this feature a reader should not take on trust.
