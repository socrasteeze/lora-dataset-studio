    repo .env — so a developer who saved a real API key via the app would
    leak it into os.environ and make "unconfigured" probes see a key. Starting each

def _isolate_user_state(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    """Point EVERY test at throwaway user state — never the real one on this
    machine. Covers the three roots the app resolves from the environment:
    ``LDS_CONFIG`` (config.json), ``LDS_DATA_DIR`` (data/: studio.db, banks,
    thumbnails, logs, the provisioned envs) and ``LDS_ENV`` (.env secrets).

    The `app` fixture already did all this — but only for tests that take it. A
    test calling a helper directly (a pure wrapper/prompt function, a service
    that resolves ``cfg.data_dir()``) fell straight through to the real files at
    the repo root. Two consequences, both bad:

    * a FALSE FAILURE the moment the developer customises anything in Settings —
      an edited Klein identity prompt made the "shipped default" wrapper tests
      fail on that machine only;
    * worse, a FALSE PASS: on a clean checkout the same tests assert the default
      behaviour and pass for the wrong reason, so CI can never catch the drift.

    And for the writable roots it is not just wrong readings: ``cfg.data_dir()``
    CREATES the directory it returns, ``save_config()`` writes wherever
    LDS_CONFIG points and ``set_secrets()`` rewrites ENV_PATH — so an unisolated
    test could edit the user's live settings, drop files next to their studio.db
    or touch their .env. A test run must never be able to do that.

    ``_cache`` is a module global keyed on nothing but "has it been loaded", so
    resetting it is what actually makes the config redirect take effect.
    ``ENV_PATH`` is worse: it is resolved ONCE at import, so the env var alone
    would not move it — the attribute has to be patched too (same reason the
    `app` fixture patches it).
