    'nt' for the cleanup walk.

    1, so a batch a PRIOR test began on 'dataset 1' would look live to the next
    test's fresh 'dataset 1' — enough to make the kind-switch guard 409 spuriously.
    Clear it around every test so in-memory activity never leaks across cases.

    The bank folder-sync cooldowns are process-global for the same reason: bank
    id 1 of a prior test would make the next test's first walk a no-op.

    The vision keep-warm LEASE is the sneakiest of the set: it is granted BEFORE
    the vision call (even one that fails against a dead Ollama), lives 120 s in a
    module global, and every later test whose code path is "about to take the
    GPU" calls revoke() -> a REAL HTTP POST to whatever answers on the Ollama
    URL. Both known symptoms come from that one lease: a test that merely
    imported an image with crop=True poisoned every training-launch test for the
    next two minutes with ~4 s of real HTTP retries against 127.0.0.1:11434

    failed once in a full suite and never alone. The suite must never depend on a
    lease left behind by an earlier test, nor talk to a live Ollama by accident.

    The 🔤 text-search query cache is a third one, and it bites the same way in
    reverse: it is keyed by PHRASE only (a CLIP vector depends on the checkpoint,
    not on the bank), so a query encoded by one test would be served from memory
    to the next — whose LDS_DATA_DIR is a different empty tmp dir. A test proving
    "the encoder is invoked exactly once" would then see zero calls and fail, and
    one proving "no ML python ⇒ 503" would silently get a cache hit and a 200.

    ``LDS_CONFIG`` (config.json), ``LDS_DATA_DIR`` (data/: studio.db, banks,
    thumbnails, logs, the provisioned envs) and ``LDS_ENV`` (.env secrets).

    The `app` fixture already did all this — but only for tests that take it. A
    test calling a helper directly (a pure wrapper/prompt function, a service
    that resolves ``cfg.data_dir()``) fell straight through to the real files at
    the repo root. Two consequences, both bad:

    * a FALSE FAILURE the moment the developer customises anything in Settings —
      an edited Klein identity prompt made the "shipped default" wrapper tests
      fail on that machine only;
    * worse, a FALSE PASS: on a clean checkout the same tests assert the default
      behaviour and pass for the wrong reason, so CI can never catch the drift.

    And for the writable roots it is not just wrong readings: ``cfg.data_dir()``
    CREATES the directory it returns, ``save_config()`` writes wherever
    LDS_CONFIG points and ``set_secrets()`` rewrites ENV_PATH — so an unisolated
    test could edit the user's live settings, drop files next to their studio.db
    or touch their .env. A test run must never be able to do that.

    ``_cache`` is a module global keyed on nothing but "has it been loaded", so
    resetting it is what actually makes the config redirect take effect.
    ``ENV_PATH`` is worse: it is resolved ONCE at import, so the env var alone
