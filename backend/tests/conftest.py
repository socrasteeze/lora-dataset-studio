    Also CLEAR them at setup: config.py runs load_dotenv(ENV_PATH) at import, and at
    collection time (before LDS_ENV is pointed at a tmp file) ENV_PATH is the real
    repo .env — so a developer who saved a real API key via the app would
    leak it into os.environ and make "unconfigured" probes see a key. Starting each
    test with the keys unset makes the suite independent of the local .env; tests

def _reset_inmemory_registries():
    """dataset_activity is a process-global in-memory store (a batch dies with the
    process, not the request). With :memory: DBs each test restarts dataset ids at
    1, so a batch a PRIOR test began on 'dataset 1' would look live to the next
    test's fresh 'dataset 1' — enough to make the kind-switch guard 409 spuriously.
    Clear it around every test so in-memory activity never leaks across cases.

    The bank folder-sync cooldowns are process-global for the same reason: bank
    id 1 of a prior test would make the next test's first walk a no-op.

    The vision keep-warm LEASE is the sneakiest of the set: it is granted BEFORE
    the vision call (even one that fails against a dead Ollama), lives 120 s in a
    module global, and every later test whose code path is "about to take the
    GPU" calls revoke() -> a REAL HTTP POST to whatever answers on the Ollama
    URL. Both known symptoms come from that one lease: a test that merely
    imported an image with crop=True poisoned every training-launch test for the
    next two minutes with ~4 s of real HTTP retries against 127.0.0.1:11434
    (Windows walks ::1 then 127.0.0.1 per attempt) -- how test_dataset_service
    made test_stop_waits_until_launch_publishes_the_new_pid fail on CI while both
    passed alone; and the launch under test paid for a live unload of a real
    Ollama, which can take tens of seconds -- how test_training_queue_atomic
    failed once in a full suite and never alone. The suite must never depend on a
    lease left behind by an earlier test, nor talk to a live Ollama by accident."""

def _isolate_user_state(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    """Point EVERY test at throwaway user state — never the real one on this
    machine. Covers the three roots the app resolves from the environment:
    ``LDS_CONFIG`` (config.json), ``LDS_DATA_DIR`` (data/: studio.db, banks,
    thumbnails, logs, the provisioned envs) and ``LDS_ENV`` (.env secrets).

    The `app` fixture already did all this — but only for tests that take it. A
    test calling a helper directly (a pure wrapper/prompt function, a service
    that resolves ``cfg.data_dir()``) fell straight through to the real files at
    the repo root. Two consequences, both bad:

    * a FALSE FAILURE the moment the developer customises anything in Settings —
      an edited Klein identity prompt made the "shipped default" wrapper tests
      fail on that machine only;
    * worse, a FALSE PASS: on a clean checkout the same tests assert the default
      behaviour and pass for the wrong reason, so CI can never catch the drift.

    And for the writable roots it is not just wrong readings: ``cfg.data_dir()``
    CREATES the directory it returns, ``save_config()`` writes wherever
    LDS_CONFIG points and ``set_secrets()`` rewrites ENV_PATH — so an unisolated
    test could edit the user's live settings, drop files next to their studio.db
    or touch their .env. A test run must never be able to do that.

    ``_cache`` is a module global keyed on nothing but "has it been loaded", so
    resetting it is what actually makes the config redirect take effect.
    ``ENV_PATH`` is worse: it is resolved ONCE at import, so the env var alone
    would not move it — the attribute has to be patched too (same reason the
    `app` fixture patches it).
