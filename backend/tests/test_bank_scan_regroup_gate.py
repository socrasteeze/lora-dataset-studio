"""🗃️ Image bank — when the quality scan re-groups duplicates, and how it says so.

The owner's report was "Scan quality freezes LDS". What actually froze was the
TAIL of the pass: `rebuild_dup_groups` ran unconditionally, over every hashed row
of the bank, on a scan that had almost nothing to scan. Measured on the real
database: 50 397 rows, scan pool = 2, and the phase re-grouped the other 50 389
for 96 to 124 s with the bar sitting at 100 %.

Two rules come out of that, and both are easy to get wrong in opposite ways:

  • a scan that changed no stored hash must NOT re-group — its input is
    byte-for-byte what produced the groups already on screen;
  • but the 🎚 panel's "↻ Re-group duplicates" runs THROUGH the scan endpoint
    precisely because that tail existed, and its pool is empty by construction on
    an already-scanned bank. Gating on the pool alone turns that button into a
    no-op that reports success — which is worse than the freeze, because nothing
    tells the user their new dup_distance was ignored.

And the phase now reports progress and honours Stop, which it did not: there was
no `progress`, no `bump` and no `cancelled` anywhere in its body.
