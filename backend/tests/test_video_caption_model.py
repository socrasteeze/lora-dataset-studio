"""WHICH model writes the captions — and why that had to become a setting.

The pass shipped with one checkpoint hard-coded. On a real corpus that turned out
to be a dataset defect rather than a matter of taste: the default model
EUPHEMISES. It describes plainly visible things in evasive terms and never names
them — 171 captions, zero refusals, and a vocabulary that circled the subject
throughout. A caption that talks around what it shows teaches the model being
trained to look away too, and nothing in the output reveals it. The captions read
fine. They are simply about something slightly other than the footage.

Three consequences, one test section each:

  * THE DEFAULT DOES NOT MOVE. An install that sets nothing captions exactly as
    it did yesterday. A silently changed captioner would silently change every
    dataset built afterwards, and the two would look identical on disk.
  * NOTHING IS DOWNLOADED IN SILENCE. Pointing the setting at a model this
    machine does not have means gigabytes over someone's connection. The pass
    says so BEFORE it starts, in the job line already on screen — the same
    philosophy as clip_text_encoder.weights_warning(), which exists so a first
    search cannot stall for ten minutes with nothing said.
  * EVERY CAPTION REMEMBERS WHO WROTE IT. Two checkpoints do not produce
    comparable captions, and changing the setting mid-corpus is precisely what
    this feature invites. A bank captioned half by one and half by another is
    unreadable unless each row says which.

No model is ever loaded here: the worker is a seam and is monkeypatched.
