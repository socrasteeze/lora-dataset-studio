"""🎨 Medium runs by itself at the end of ✨ Score.

Why it may: Medium performs NO image inference. It reads the embeddings Score
just cached and multiplies them by a handful of text vectors — no GPU, and
0.16 s for 23 000 images. Leaving it behind its own button meant a bank sat
there holding the data for the answer but not the answer.

What is pinned here is what makes that safe to do automatically:
  * the chain never turns a finished Score red — not when the text encoder is
    missing, not when the classification itself blows up;
  * whatever happens is SAID on the pass's own line, including "skipped" with
    its reason, because a pass that silently did less than you think is worse
    than one that did nothing;
  * a stopped Score does not chain;
  * the manual button still works, and still re-classifies on rescan, which the
    chain deliberately never does.

No model is loaded: the prototype matrix is monkeypatched exactly as
test_bank_medium_angle.py does.
