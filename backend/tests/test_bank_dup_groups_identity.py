"""🗃️ Image bank — the duplicate grouping still returns EXACTLY the old groups.

The pairwise comparison inside `rebuild_dup_groups` was rewritten from a Python
double loop (plus an unbounded `set` of every pair already looked at — 829 MB at
16 000 images, and the garbage collector sweeping it was ~79 % of the phase's
wall time) to the blocked numpy form `rebuild_semantic_dup_groups` already uses.

A rewrite of a grouping is not a refactor the tests can take on trust: `dup_group`
is what the user SEES in the duplicates panel, and a version that groups "the same
in spirit" would change their bank without anyone noticing. So the old algorithm
lives on below, verbatim, as an oracle, and these tests assert the two produce the
same groups — the same ids, on the same images — over random hashes, over hashes
built to be adversarial (exact ties, chains, one huge group), and at every
distance the setting allows.
