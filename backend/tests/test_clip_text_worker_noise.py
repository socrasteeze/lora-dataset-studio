"""The CLIP text worker must survive a stdout that is not only its own.

Reported from a real install: 🎨 Medium died with "the text encoder produced no
result — check the ✨ Score interpreter" on a machine whose ✨ Score interpreter
was provably fine (the pass that produced the embeddings had just run). The
parent read ONE line of the child's stdout and called json.loads on it, so any
first-run banner — a weights download, an interpreter greeting, a dependency
announcing itself — became "no result". Text SEARCH takes the same road and was
broken by the same line.

These tests run a REAL subprocess (a stub interpreter, no model is ever loaded)
because the property under test lives in the pipe: a mocked encoder cannot print
a banner. What they pin:

  * a noisy worker still ENCODES — both through 🎨 Medium's prototype matrix and
    through the 🔎 text-search route;
  * when the worker really fails, the message QUOTES what it printed, on stdout
    and on stderr, instead of blaming a component it never looked at;
  * that quote is paste-safe: a home-dir path in the child's chatter is redacted
    before it reaches a message a user pastes into a public thread.
