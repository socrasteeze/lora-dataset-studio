""" Promote a selection into a NEW BANK — the second destination.

Promoting used to lead to exactly one place: a dataset. A dataset is a strict,
training-bound container, and isolating 200 candidates out of a 9 000-image dump
to work on them further is not the same intent. So the promote dialog gained a
second door, built on the SAME machinery as ``/bank/from-dataset``: a name, a
202 + background job, and the new bank's id back so the UI can jump to it.

The one rule this file exists to prove: **banks never share their files**. The
copy is a real copy — different path AND different inode — because the app
rewrites images in place (re-crop, watermark cleaning), and a shared inode would
turn "two independent banks" into one at the first edit. The source bank keeps
its rows, marked promoted with the destination that received them.
