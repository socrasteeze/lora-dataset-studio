"""The FINAL save of a run carries no step number in its filename
(`lora_<trigger>.safetensors`, never `..._000003000.safetensors`). Two views used
to number it differently: the ◉ Graph, reading a cloud run's staging, called it
the run's target (3000), while the local checkpoint list — the "active set" the
▶ Continue dialog resumes — filed it under the last NUMBERED save (2750), where
the dialog's dedup swallowed it. A pill the graph offered was then refused with a
message blaming the family/base/variant selection.

Reported by the owner on a Krea 2 run: 12 saves on disk, 250…2750 numbered plus
the unnumbered final, run declared 3000 steps, pill "3k" not resumable.
