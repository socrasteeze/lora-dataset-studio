"""Reattaching to a pod that is already training (run #146, 2026-08-03).

The app restarted while a dense run was at step 825/3000, with three saved
checkpoints. The boot-wait adopted it at 16:01:58, the vast API answered one
poll without the instance in its listing, and ten seconds later the run was
condemned: the boot budget is anchored to the run's durable created_at, so a
run that has been alive for hours enters its "boot" wait with the whole budget
already spent. Everything after that followed: the dense recovery stopped the
remote job — and the pod, which was perfectly reachable the whole time, obeyed
and killed the training.

Two independent guarantees are asserted here:

* the vast API is not the authority on whether the pod exists. When the row
  already carries a base_url, the pod itself is asked;
* a reattach is not a boot. Its window is the same bounded tolerance the poll
  loop grants a pod that stops answering mid-run — minutes of CONSECUTIVE
  silence, measured from this attempt — never a single unlucky poll.

Plus the anti-masking pair: a resume whose job never started keeps the durable
anchor of the 2026-07-14 incident, and a pod that is really gone is still given
up (without a stop it cannot receive, and without banning a host that was
training fine minutes ago).
