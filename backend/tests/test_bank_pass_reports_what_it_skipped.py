"""🗃️ Image bank — a pass never reports its successes without its failures.

Reported on Discord (2026-08-07) by `_mr.arrow_` as "framing is not getting
persisted", then narrowed by him to the sentence this file exists for: "Running a
new framing added 4 new framed images, out of the 12 images it got through before
cancelling."

Nothing was broken about the persistence. His diagnostic showed, every ~5 s:

    ERROR app.gpu_window: vision GPU window renewal failed
    sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked
    [SQL: UPDATE system_state SET value=?, updated_at=? WHERE key = ?]  ('vision_in_progress')

`database is locked` fails the renewal, `_admit_local_ollama` is fail-closed and
raises `LocalOllamaFenceError`, and the image is never shown to the model. Leaving
`framing` NULL there is CORRECT — it is what lets a re-run finish the job, where
writing 'unknown' would freeze an error into the bank. What was wrong is that the
pass said none of it: the cancelled branch named `classified` and nothing else, so
8 unclassified images out of 12 were reported as "4 classified so far", and the
only reading left to the user was that framing does not persist.

The tests below pin the REPORTING, on the rendered value of `job['detail']`:

    every ending of a pass — the finished one and the cancelled one — names
    every image the pass did not write, and says which kind of not-written.
