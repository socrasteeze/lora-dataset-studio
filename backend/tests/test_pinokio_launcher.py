"""The Pinokio launcher must keep pointing at the app it launches.

The launcher scripts at the repo root (pinokio.js / install.js / start.js /
update.js / reset.js) hardcode three facts about this project: the requirements
file, the server entry point, and the venv folder. None of them is imported by
Python, so a rename would move the code and leave the launcher silently
launching nothing — the failure would only surface on a stranger's machine,
inside Pinokio, which nobody runs in CI. These assertions are the cheap link
between the two.

They check the *contract*, not the prose: the referenced paths must exist on
disk, and the behaviours a Pinokio launcher needs (daemon mode, an Open Web UI
url set from the real bound address, a fast-forward-only update) must still be
declared.
