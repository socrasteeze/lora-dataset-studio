"""A test module may not import a third-party package nobody declared.

THREE releases have now failed on the same shape, each time a different package:

* pytest-flask — present on a dev box, absent from CI, so nine tests that forgot
  `with app.app_context():` passed locally and came back red on the tag;
* safetensors — `test_zimage_convert_streaming.py` guarded on Torch with
  `importorskip` and then imported safetensors unguarded, which only bites on a
  machine that HAS Torch. That machine is CI;
* instaloader — `test_instagram_scan.py` imports it at module level. It ships in
  the OPTIONAL `requirements-scrape.txt`, so a contributor who ran the scraper
  once carries it transitively and stays green, while CI installs
  `requirements-dev.txt` and nothing else and cannot even COLLECT the module.

Each was found by a red release tag, which is the most expensive place to find it:
the suite is green on every machine that has the package, so nothing points at the
declaration until the release job runs. This test moves that discovery to the
commit that introduces it.

It is a PURE TEXT + AST check. It does not import anything, does not touch the
network, and does not care whether the package is installed HERE — being installed
here is precisely the illusion that let all three through.

WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, on purpose: imports inside a function or a `try`. Those are
the shapes `pytest.importorskip` and lazy seams take, and both are legitimate — a
suite that runs a subset when an optional extra is absent is the intended design.
Only a MODULE-LEVEL import is a hard collection dependency.
