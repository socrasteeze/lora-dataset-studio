"""🎚 The duration cut — the one quality cut that needs no measurement pass.

TransNetV2 runs with `min_shot_frames=5` on purpose: a real flash cut is a real
shot, and a detector that refuses to emit one hides genuine boundaries. The price
is a triage grid peppered with half-second shots that can never reach a dataset —
`command_for_profile` refuses them at promotion — but that refusal happens at the
END, after the user has already scrolled past them a hundred times.

Two things separate this cut from the other eight and both are tested here:

  * duration is on the CLIP ROW, derived from the bounds, so it is known for
    every clip the moment it is detected. There is no "unmeasured" state for it,
    which means the cut works on a bank nobody has run the metrics pass over —
    and that is the state a user is in when the clutter first bothers them;
  * `brief` is not `too_short`. The promotion's `too_short` is an impossibility
    of the target profile; `brief` is a judgement the user sets. Same clip, two
    different sentences, and collapsing them would make a user think lowering the
    panel value buys them a dataset.
