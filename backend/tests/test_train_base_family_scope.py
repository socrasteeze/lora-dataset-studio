"""The training base is FAMILY-scoped, even though it lives in one column.

Reported symptom: a style dataset showing `LORA TYPE = Krea 2` / `BASE =
Official - Krea 2` while the summary line right below said
``base "z image\\bigLove_zt3.safetensors"``, and the cloud dialog offered to
push that Z-Image file to Hugging Face for the Krea run — under a warning that
the local file was "missing" (it was not: a Z-Image merge NAME was being
resolved as if it were a Krea absolute path).

Two defects, one column: `train_base_model` is global, so switching the family
left the previous family's base attached; and the panel re-seeded itself from
that column on every mount, which is why "change the model and come back" (a
purely client-side reset) fixed it until the next reload.
