"""🗃️ Bank passes — an exact number is not an honest one on its own.

Three symptoms, one family: a figure the code could prove, printed without the
context that makes it readable.

  * ✨ Score went MUTE for minutes after its per-image counter reached N/N — the
    cache write and the n² style grouping publish nothing — so a full bar and a
    stale count sat there while the pass worked. The Stop button stays offered
    throughout, and what a Stop destroys is not the same at every step.
  * the style grouping reported "1 style group(s) of 2+" both when almost
    nothing grouped and when EVERYTHING did (measured: one group holding 24 928
    of 24 931 images). Two opposite failures, one sentence.
  * 🎨 Medium reported "0 classified, 2 skipped (not scored yet)" on a bank of
    50 397 images, saying nothing about the 25 464 the scope dropped before the
    pool was built.

Every assertion below is on the SENTENCE a user reads, and each negative claim
("no note when there is nothing to say") is paired with the mutation that makes
it appear — a probe that cannot fail is not a probe.
