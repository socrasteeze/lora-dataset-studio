"""🎬 The video bank service — bounds in, one flat dataset out.

The architectural promise of this lane is that a bank is a set of DECISIONS, not
a pile of media. It stores where each shot begins and ends and whether you want
it; the only bytes it ever writes are thumbnails. Encoding happens once, at
promotion, on the clips that survived triage. That is what keeps a 340-clip bank
from costing 340 encodes to keep 128 of them, and it is what keeps the user's
source folder readable-only in the literal sense.

Every test here defends one of the ways that promise, or the trainers reading its
output, could be broken quietly:

  * a source folder whose files are named .MOV rather than .mov scans as EMPTY —
    the bank is created, the user is told nothing, and the folder looks broken;
  * a rejected clip that still reaches ffmpeg costs minutes per bank and defeats
    the whole design;
  * a clip cut from frame INDICES drifts on variable-frame-rate material, which
    is most scraped material;
  * a missing .txt sidecar CRASHES musubi-tuner and is silently DROPPED by
    diffusion-pipe;
  * a subfolder under a dataset root is picked up by ai-toolkit's RECURSIVE scan
    and trained on without a word.

No ffmpeg, no PyAV, no torch: probing, detection, thumbnailing and encoding are
each a single monkeypatchable seam, because CI has none of them installed.
