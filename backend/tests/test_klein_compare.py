"""⚖ Compare Klein models before the batch — the judging half, held to its rules.

The user's ask, in shape: the same intermediate window the detection scan has,
but for the Klein clean — pick models, run them on ONE flagged image with ONE
seed, adopt the winner. What these tests hold:

- the preview NEVER touches the original file (the whole point of a preview);
- one call = one model, same image, same seed — the dialog's grid varies on the
  model and nothing else;
- both surfaces answer through the SAME service, so they cannot drift;
- the bank's per-run override reaches the inpaint call, while the bank still
  STORES no pick (the old doctrine, kept).
