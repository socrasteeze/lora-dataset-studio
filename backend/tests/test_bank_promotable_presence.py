"""🗃️ Image bank — "already promoted into this dataset" is MEASURED, not remembered.

A bank used to mark an image promoted with a one-way flag. Delete that image in
the dataset and the flag stayed: the bank then advertised nothing promotable
into a dataset that held none of its images, which reads exactly like "the bank
lost my images" — the report these tests come from.

The bank now reads the back-link the promotion writes on the dataset row, so
deleting the image there gives the image back. Everything is asserted through
the service (the promote job body is run inline; in production it is a thread).
