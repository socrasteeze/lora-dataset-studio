"""WHICH prompt writes the captions — the lock that turned out to dominate.

The model was made configurable first, on the theory that the checkpoint decided
how plainly a caption described its footage. An A/B on real material said
otherwise, and that measurement is why this file exists:

    base model     + the standard prompt            -> evasive, circled the subject
    uncensored 8B  + the standard prompt            -> barely better, hid behind
                                                       the camera
    uncensored 8B  + an explicit-permission prompt  -> named things precisely
    BASE model     + that same prompt               -> named things precisely too,
                                                       with the best action writing
                                                       of the four

So the dominant lock is the PROMPT, not the checkpoint. A captioner describes
what it has been given permission to describe, and the shipped prompt never
granted it. That makes the prompt a setting for the same reason the model became
one: a caption that talks around what it shows teaches the trained model to look
away, and the output reads perfectly well either way.

Two styles, and the boundary between them is a promise:
  * `standard` — unchanged, and the DEFAULT. An install that sets nothing
    captions exactly as it did before.
  * `plain` — grants explicit permission to name what is shown, and forbids the
    two words the measurement caught it hiding behind.

Every caption records the style that produced it, exactly as it records the
model: two styles do not write comparable captions either, and mixing them across
one bank is precisely what making this configurable invites.
