"""The unit suite must not reach a live ComfyUI.

Not a style rule — a stability one. `gpu_exclusive_vision_window` is opened by
the bank's vision passes, the caption passes, the studio and the watermark
passes, and every one of those windows fired a real
`POST http://127.0.0.1:8188/free {"unload_models": true, "free_memory": true}`
with a 10 s timeout. Measured on 2026-07-28, eleven test files did this on every
run.

What that buys is a duration nobody controls: instant when ComfyUI is not
listening, seconds when it is busy generating, ten seconds when the port answers
but the server is wedged. Tests in `test_bank_vision_concurrency` assert on
elapsed time ("Stop returns in under 5 s"), so their verdict depended on what an
unrelated program was doing at that second — the exact shape that gets filed as
"flake, sensitive to load" and, on 2026-07-17, cost a release.

It also had a side effect on the developer's machine: running `pytest` unloaded
the models of a ComfyUI that was minding its own business.
