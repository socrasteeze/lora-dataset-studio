"""✂ Editing an image must not silently re-compress it.

Four operations rewrite the working image the trainer will later `copy2` verbatim:
mirror, rotate, crop and the watermark crop. Mirror and rotate already preserved the
source format; crop re-encoded EVERYTHING to lossy WEBP q92, so cropping a PNG
degraded it and left PNG-named files holding WEBP bytes. These tests pin the rule
they now share (`app.services.image_encoding`), pin that each one STATES its own
encoding policy rather than inheriting a global default, and — just as importantly —
pin that the throwaway derivatives were NOT dragged along with it.

Note on wording: crop also RESIZES — a box LONGER than 1024 is normalised down to a
1024 long side. It no longer ENLARGES a smaller box (that upscale invented no detail
and cost 2.3x the bytes); `upscale_ratio` still records how far under the training
resolution the box was. Downscaling is destructive by nature, so nothing here claims
a lossless CROP. What is proven lossless is the ENCODING step: the bytes on disk
decode back to exactly the crop+resize result.
