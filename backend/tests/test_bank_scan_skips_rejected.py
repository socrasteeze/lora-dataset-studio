"""🗃️ Image bank — the quality scan leaves rejected images alone.

Every other pass (faces, score, framing, watermark, captions) already filtered
`status != 'reject'`; the quality scan did not. On a real 30 000-image bank with
two thirds rejected, a rescan spent two thirds of its time decoding shots the
user had already thrown away.

The subtlety these tests pin down: the scan is ALSO what rejects unreadable
files, so skipping rejected rows must not stop a FIRST scan from doing that.
