"""The minutes between the click and step 1, made observable.

A cloud launch rents a machine and waits for it to boot: several minutes is
normal, and run #134 (production) died on 'pod did not become ready in time —
no boot progress for 25 min'. Both looked identical from the UI — one frozen
'Launching…' button and, later, one motionless phase sentence. The monitor
always knew which step it was on; ``launch_view`` is that knowledge, ordered
and clocked.

Everything here is offline: no pod, no vast API, no thread.
