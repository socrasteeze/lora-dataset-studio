"""✨ Upscale & improve, run on an image of the ◉ Canvas board.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN LANE, and not a reuse of `/api/dataset/image/<id>/improve`:
the board's pictures are `lora_test_image` rows (that is what
`canvas_image_node.image_id` stores) while the dataset route resolves a
`face_dataset_image`. The two tables have INDEPENDENT autoincrement id spaces,
so handing a board id to the dataset route does NOT 404 — it finds a real,
unrelated dataset image and improves that one. That silent wrong answer is the
bug this whole file exists to make impossible.

The result row lives in `lora_test_image` because the board must be able to pin
it, and that is the hazard: an audit of the 21 read sites in lora_test_studio.py
found TEN that would read it as a Test Studio CELL. The tests below pin the
boundary in BOTH directions — invisible to the studio, visible in the gallery —
because a future contributor "harmonising" either half silently deletes a
feature or resurrects a bug.
