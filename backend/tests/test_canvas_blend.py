"""🧬 Blend from the ◉ LoRA Canvas — every ticked checkpoint in ONE generation.

The board used to run one pass per pick. Blend is the Test Studio's Combine mode
driven from the board: the picks are loaded together, each at its own weight, and
every dataset's trigger word is injected into the prompt.

What is pinned here is the CHAIN, end to end, and not just the flag:

  · the route forwards `combine` and the per-selection `weight` untouched — a
    dropped flag degrades a blend into a comparison grid in silence, which looks
    like "it worked" until you count the images;
  · the workflow ACTUALLY SUBMITTED to ComfyUI carries N chained LoRA loaders at
    their own strengths and both triggers in the text encoder. That assertion is
    made on the real `_build_cell_workflow` output captured at the queue's door,
    not on the arguments handed to a mock;
  · the canvas index carries each dataset's trigger word, which is what lets the
    panel NAME what it is about to inject instead of doing it silently.
