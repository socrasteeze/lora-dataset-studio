"""Launching a video training on THIS machine, and the three ways that can lie.

WHY A SECOND LAUNCHER AND NOT A BRANCH OF `launch_training`
-----------------------------------------------------------
`lora_training.launch_training` reads a `FaceDataset` from its first line to its
last: it exports images, checks captions, resolves a trigger word, names the run
from a base-model tag and freezes an image manifest in the provenance registry. A
video dataset has none of those columns and none of those artefacts — its folder
is ALREADY the flat mp4 + homonym .txt shape ai-toolkit reads. Threading a second
entity through that function would mean a `getattr(ds, ..., None)` at every one of
those steps, which is not a branch, it is a config assembled from defaults nobody
can see. What IS shared is the part that must be shared: the ai-toolkit paths, the
GPU admission sequence, the durable ownership fence and the crash watcher.

THE THREE LIES THIS FILE IS WRITTEN AGAINST
-------------------------------------------
1. A button that starts something which cannot finish. MiniMax H3 needs ~43 GB of
   weights that are not on most machines. Starting anyway means the "training" is
   in fact an unannounced multi-hour download, and on a full disk it is a crash
   an hour in. The size is named BEFORE anything is fetched, and fetching is a
   separate, explicit yes.
2. A run attributed to the wrong dataset. The durable training fence keys on
   `training_dataset_id`, an integer — and face dataset #3 and video dataset #3
   both exist. Without a table stamp the image lane's status panel would name a
   face dataset for a video run, and its Stop button would kill it.
3. A resume from someone else's weights. ai-toolkit resumes automatically from
   whatever it finds in the run folder, and the run folder is named after the
   dataset. Two video datasets of the same name — or one dataset re-promoted to a
   different target — share that folder, and the second run loads the first's
   LoRA into a different architecture.

Nothing here spawns a process or touches a GPU: the spawn seam is injected.
