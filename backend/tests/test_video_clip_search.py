"""🎬 Type a word, get the scenes — the embedding pass and the search over it.

Two halves, and the interesting decisions are all in the seams between them.

THE PASS embeds SEVERAL frames per shot, not one. A shot is a span of time, and
a thumbnail is one instant of it: a car that only enters frame in the last second
is invisible to a search that embedded the opening frame, and there is no error
to see — the clip simply never comes back. So each clip contributes a frame near
its start, its ambassador frame (the sharpest one the metrics scan measured), and
one near its end, and a clip's score for a query is the MAX over those. That is
the whole reason this file exists rather than a two-line reuse of the image lane.

THE SEARCH reuses the image bank's text encoder untouched (one CLIP checkpoint,
one query cache, app-wide) and its honesty rules: a ranking is not a filter, a
clip with no embedding cannot be found by any phrase and that has to be said out
loud, and no similarity threshold is invented because the measurements say no
threshold separates relevant from unrelated.

Both heavy seams — the frame decode and the ML subprocess — are monkeypatched
here, so the suite stays green with neither PyAV nor torch installed.
