"""The list behind the model-file pickers, and the refusal that protects it.

Two questions, and the second is the expensive one:

  1. does the picker offer exactly what the RESOLVER can load? A second way of
     listing model files is how a dropdown starts offering a file the graph
     refuses (or hiding one it would happily load, the day an install has an
     extra_model_paths.yaml);
  2. what happens when a pinned file is NOT there? It used to be a log line and
     a silent election — the failure mode that ran a whole training on a
     third-party finetune nobody chose.
