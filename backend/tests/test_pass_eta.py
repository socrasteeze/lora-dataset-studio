"""What "about two hours left" is allowed to mean.

TIME IS INJECTED, ALWAYS. Not one test here sleeps: a rate test that sleeps is a
rate test that goes flaky the moment the machine is busy, and a machine running
several bank passes is exactly when this code is read. Every scenario below is a
list of (instant, done) handed straight to the estimator.

The scenarios are the measured ones, not invented ones:
* ✨ Score resuming from cache — `resuming — 20847 of 21220 already cached`,
  twenty thousand rows in about two seconds, then 373 images on the GPU for an
  hour and a half.
* a steady GPU pass at 6.4 images/s, which predicted 1 h 27 and took 1 h 27.
* the style grouping, which publishes done=0/total=0 for 181 s.
