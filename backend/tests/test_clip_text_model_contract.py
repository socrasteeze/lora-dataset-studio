"""The image half and the text half of CLIP must load the SAME model.

🔤 Text search ranks a query vector (from ``clip_text_infer.py``) against the
image vectors ``bank_score_infer.py`` cached. Cosine similarity between vectors
produced by two DIFFERENT CLIP configurations is meaningless — and, crucially,
it does not look meaningless: the dot product returns numbers in the usual range
and a ranking that is plausible at a glance but is noise. No exception, no
crash, nothing in a log. It is the worst failure mode this feature has, so it
gets a test of its own rather than a comment.

The pair is asserted textually, on the source, because the only environment that
can actually import open_clip is the ML interpreter — not the Flask venv the
suite runs in. A textual contract still catches the realistic regression: someone
"modernises" one script's model id (say to the `-quickgelu` variant that matches
how the openai weights were really trained) and silently invalidates every
comparison against every already-scored bank.

⚠ Known, deliberate divergence from upstream: the `openai` ViT-L-14 weights were
trained WITH QuickGELU, and `'ViT-L-14'` builds a plain-GELU model — open_clip
warns about it on every load. Every embedding cached on every install out there
was produced that way. Switching to `'ViT-L-14-quickgelu'` would be more correct
in the abstract and would invalidate every scored bank in practice, so it is a
migration to schedule, NOT a one-line fix. Both halves stay wrong together, on
purpose, until that migration happens.
