"""The four family scanners, pinned file by file on ONE tree.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Four functions walk the same ComfyUI folders looking for one family's weights:
`comfyui.get_krea_models`, `comfyui.get_zimage_models`,
`krea_edit_helper._krea_unet_folders` and `klein_edit_helper._klein_unet_folders`.
They were four hand-written walks, and their drift has already shipped a bug —
two of them answered differently about the SAME folder, so a file the picker
offered was a file the resolver refused.

These tests are a GOLDEN RECORD taken before the four walks were folded onto two
shared ones. Every list below was produced by the code as it stood, on the tree
built by the `tree` fixture; the refactor is only allowed if they all stay green.
They are deliberately exact-equality assertions on full lists rather than `in`
checks: a consolidation that quietly widens or narrows a list is exactly the
failure mode, and a membership test would sail straight past it.

WHERE THE FOUR STILL DISAGREE, ON PURPOSE OR NOT
------------------------------------------------
One difference is pinned here rather than fixed, because removing it would be a
behaviour change and that pass was a refactor:

  * DEPTH. `get_*_models` walk the tree (`os.walk`), so a model two folders deep
    is listed. `_*_unet_folders` read ONE level, so the same file is invisible to
    the Generate resolvers. Not levelled blind: which of the two matches what
    ComfyUI itself lists is a question that deserves its own measurement.

The other one was levelled, in its own commit and on purpose — see
`test_both_listers_offer_every_krea_file_the_user_has` below.

    not even agree about where: the Studio dropped it at a root only, Generate
    everywhere, so the same file was offered or hidden depending on which folder
    it happened to sit in.

    Both now list it. Hiding a file that sits on the user's own disk told them
    nothing — not that it existed, not why it was gone — and choosing is theirs to
    do. The measured fact did not disappear: it moved from filter to warning, and
