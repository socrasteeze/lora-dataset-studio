"""A bank refusing a click because it is BUSY must say WHICH pass is in the way.

The report behind this file: Filter thresholds ▸ "↻ Re-group duplicates"
returned a red banner reading "a scan job is already running on this bank" and
nothing else — no progress, no remedy. The front-end can only rephrase that into
"✨ Score pass is running — 137/412, press Stop above" if it is told the KIND;
parsing our own English sentence would be a rename away from breaking.

The refusal frequently lands BEFORE the first 2 s progress poll, so the response
body is at that instant the only thing on the client that knows what is running.
Hence: every occupied-bank 409 carries `busy_kind`.
