"""🔳 The safe zone — bands, burned-in text, and what is left of the frame.

What is under test is NOT "does RapidOCR read letters" (it is someone else's
checkpoint and it cannot be imported in this interpreter) but the decisions that
make this safe to run over somebody's bank:

  * the BAND RULE is uniformity, not darkness, so a grey or white pillarbox is
    found — and a frame that is uniform all over ABSTAINS rather than claiming to
    be all container;
  * the VOTE is a per-side MIN across the shot's frames, which is the only
    aggregation whose answer is true of every frame — the property a crop needs;
  * a text zone is STRUCTURAL only when it appears in two frames, which is what
    separates a subtitle from a shop sign, and boxes in the SAME frame are never
    merged;
  * `text_coverage` is a UNION, not a sum: two OCR boxes over one line of
    subtitle must not count twice;
  * the SAFE ZONE is an edge crop, cheapest cut first — a bottom subtitle costs
    its own height, and text in the middle of the frame honestly collapses it;
  * every degraded case is a STATE and never a zero: no frame decoded is
    'unreadable', no OCR engine is 'bars_only' with the text keys ABSENT, and an
    OCR run that did not reach a shot leaves it in the queue;
  * the verdicts are derived at READ time, so moving a cut re-sorts the bank with
    nothing rescanned.
