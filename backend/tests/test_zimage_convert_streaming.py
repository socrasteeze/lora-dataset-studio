"""The Z-Image -> diffusers converter reads one tensor at a time, and produces the
same bytes it produced when it mapped the whole checkpoint.

WHY IT CHANGED
--------------
`build_diffusers_state_dict` opened the checkpoint with
`safetensors.torch.load_file`, which memory-maps the whole container. Windows
charges a multi-GB mapping against the system commit when it is CREATED, before
one number is read. Measured on the real `z_image_turbo_bf16.safetensors`
(11.46 GB), with `psutil` sampling the process:

    imported torch + safetensors      rss=0.20 GB   private_commit= 0.18 GB
    after load_file(whole container)  rss=0.20 GB   private_commit=11.67 GB   (0.1 s)
    after build_diffusers_state_dict  rss=5.81 GB   private_commit=14.87 GB

Resident memory did not move when the commit jumped by the size of the file:
that is a reservation, not a read. The Z-Image checkpoints on the machine this
was measured on run from 5.73 GB to 16.87 GB, so the largest one asked for about
22 GB of commit to be CONVERTED. On a 16 GB machine with a default paging file
that is `OSError 1455`, and on the machine the code is written on — 106 GB of
paging file — it is invisible. Same defect class as the one removed from
`fp8_export` the same day, on another lane.

WHAT THESE TESTS PIN
--------------------
The two properties that make the fix a fix rather than a rewrite:

  * the conversion is EQUIVALENT — byte for byte, on a synthetic checkpoint with
    the real key structure, against the old algorithm spelled out here in full so
    the comparison is against what shipped, not against the new code's opinion of
    itself;
  * nothing memory-maps any more, asserted at source level (the real defect needs
    a multi-GB file AND a machine short on commit, which is never the machine the
    test runs on — so the test says what it checks: this spelling coming back).
