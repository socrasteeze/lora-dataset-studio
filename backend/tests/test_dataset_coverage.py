"""Dataset coverage — the variety read under the composition meter.

Two things are worth proving and they are different. The lexicon
(``caption_coverage``) is a pure function of strings: it can be pinned exactly,
so it is, including the false positive it is known to have. The service on top
is about the POOL and the honesty counters — that a rejected image does not
count, that "no captions" says so instead of drawing an empty panel.

Nothing here runs a model: the whole feature is DB rows plus regex.
