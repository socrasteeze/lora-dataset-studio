"""🗃️ Bank ↔ 🎨 Medium and ⤢ Angle: the two classifier-backed facets.

What is pinned here is the HONESTY of the two measurements, because both are
weaker than a chip row makes them look:

  * a medium verdict is given only when the CLIP margin clears a cut that was
    MEASURED (a low one for photographs, a six-times-higher one for everything
    else), and 'unsure' is a real answer rather than a placeholder;
  * an image the ✨ Score pass never reached has NO medium at all — "not scored
    yet" and "unsure" are different statements and must not merge;
  * a face with no measured yaw is "not measured", never 'frontal';
  * 'from behind' costs TWO passes and refuses to guess from one;
  * the ⤢ backfill exists, is counted, and never runs on its own.

No model is ever loaded: the prototype matrix is the one thing that needs CLIP,
and it is monkeypatched — exactly like the text-search tests do.
