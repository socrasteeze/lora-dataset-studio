"""The phase that cost two hours of a rented pod without reporting one byte.

Incident (run #138, 2026-08-02). A dense Krea run staged a 24 GB dataset —
12 422 files — and entered 'uploading'. `upload_dataset` was a single blocking
call that wrote nothing, so:

  * the run card said 'Uploading the dataset' and nothing else for 2 h 07;
  * every watchdog in cloud_training judges a run on database/file evidence,
    and this phase produced none, so the only limit that applied was the blind
    two-hour floor every 'silent by design' phase gets;
  * two app restarts re-adopted the run and restarted the upload from file 0,
    which no reading could reveal either;
  * the owner cancelled by hand at 2 h 07. The pod had billed ~2.73 $ and had
    never reached step 1.

The fix is evidence, not a shorter timer: the transfer reports bytes, the
progress clock is fed from them, and the phase is judged on 'nothing arrived'
instead of 'nobody wrote a row'. A slow upload must stay untouched — that is
the second half of every test below.

Everything here is offline: no pod, no network, no thread, no dollar.
