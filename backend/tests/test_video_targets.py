"""The video training-target catalogue: what every profile must declare, and the
arithmetic that turns a user's "how long should a clip be?" into a frame count the
trainer will actually accept.

These tests are PURE — no ffmpeg, no GPU, no database. That is deliberate: the
catalogue is what every other piece of the video lane derives from, so it has to
stay green on an install that has none of the video extras.

WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM, AND WHY IT MATTERS. Every value here was read in the
source of the ai-toolkit INSTALLED on the machine, not from a model card and not
from the upstream repository on the web. Those three disagree, in both directions:
a first pass researched this on GitHub and concluded LTX could not be trained,
while the local install shipped an LTX trainer; then the same web source said
MiniMax H3 was supported while the local install had no trace of it. Only the
installed version decides what a machine can do.

The app drives ai-toolkit and nothing else, so "trainable" here means "this
ai-toolkit has an architecture for it" — never "some trainer somewhere does".
