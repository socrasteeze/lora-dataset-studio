"""A model file the app offers but the user's ComfyUI does not accept.

Reported by naniii2352 (Discord, displayed name Dexter): Krea 2 generation died on
a raw ComfyUI validation error he had to decode himself —

    WORKFLOW_INVALIDE (validation ComfyUI 400): "value_not_in_list",
    "details": "unet_name: 'krea2_turbo-Q4_K_M.gguf' not in ['a.safetensors', ...]"

He spent over an hour copying the file between model folders and suspecting
ComfyUI Desktop. Two INDEPENDENT causes produce that same message, and the app
knew about neither:

(a) EXTENSION — core ComfyUI's `folder_paths.supported_pt_extensions` is
    {.ckpt,.pt,.pt2,.bin,.pth,.safetensors,.pkl,.sft}. `.gguf` is NOT in it, so
    core never scans the file whatever folder it sits in — which is exactly why
    copying it into all three model roots changed nothing. A GGUF diffusion model
    needs the third-party ComfyUI-GGUF pack and its own `UnetLoaderGGUF` node;
    the `UNETLoader` our graphs use can never open one. The app nevertheless
    LISTS `.gguf` in its own pickers (_MODEL_SUFFIXES across capabilities.py,
    krea_edit_helper.py, klein_edit_helper.py, comfy_model_paths.py), so the app
    hands the user a choice it cannot honour.

(b) WRONG INSTALL — his LDS install directory pointed at one ComfyUI tree while
    his models-folder override pointed at a different one, and his ComfyUI
    Desktop declares three model roots. The app lists models with os.listdir on
    the disk; ComfyUI serves them from wherever the process that answers :8188
    was configured. Those two lists disagree by construction as soon as there is
    more than one install — a file can be in an LDS dropdown and absent from
    ComfyUI's list. Nothing here is GGUF-specific: it hits everyone running more
    than one ComfyUI.

The fix treats the API as the source of truth: ComfyUI publishes the filenames it
actually accepts in /object_info, so the gap is computable BEFORE queueing, the
same way `unsupported_enum_values` (shipped the same day for scheduler values)
computes it for capability values. Detection is deliberately conservative — a
name is only reported when no case/separator-normalised variant of it is in
ComfyUI's list, i.e. only when ComfyUI is certain to answer 400 anyway.

No network, no generation: /object_info is a fixture.
