"""Automatic + app-wide recovery from a stalled ComfyUI prompt.

The lived bug: a generation job died with the machine, leaving a durable
recovery barrier. That barrier blocks EVERY local generation, but its only
resolution button lived in the workspace of the dataset that owned the job — so
a user working on any other dataset met "a previous ComfyUI job has an
unresolved remote state" forever, even after doing exactly what the message
asked (restarting ComfyUI).

Two answers, and each refusal below is the reason the first one is safe:
  * provable cases resolve themselves (ComfyUI answers, and knows nothing of the
    prompt id -> the remote job is gone);
  * everything else surfaces app-wide, with one confirmed action.
