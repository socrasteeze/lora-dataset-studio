"""🗣 Captioning shots — so a search can find what HAPPENS, not only what is visible.

The CLIP pass (video_clip_search.py) embeds frames, so it finds what a moment
LOOKS like. It cannot find an action: "a woman turns and walks away" is a fact
about time, and no single frame carries it. Captions are the other half of the
question the user actually asked, and they are also what the trainer reads — a
promoted clip's `.txt` sidecar is its prompt.

WHY NOT OLLAMA, pinned here because it is the expensive mistake available: Ollama
fails SILENTLY on video on this machine — an empty response, no error, the fence
swallowing everything (grep `text generate skipped` in its logs). A captioner
that returns "" for every clip and reports success would fill a bank with empty
sidecars, which is exactly the failure ai-toolkit turns into an untrained prompt
with no message. So this lane runs transformers directly.

WHAT WAS VERIFIED ON THIS MACHINE BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN (the video lane's
absolute rule — no unverified model claim):
  * `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` is already in the HF cache
    (A:\\...\\hub\\models--Qwen--Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct, 8.3 GB, both safetensors
    shards present);
  * the ai-toolkit venv is python 3.12.9 / transformers 5.5.3 / torch 2.9.1+cu128
    with CUDA, and exposes `Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration` NATIVELY — no
    trust_remote_code, no pinning;
  * `Qwen3VLProcessor` accepts `videos=` directly and carries a chat template, so
    `qwen_vl_utils` (which is NOT installed) is not needed: the parent samples
    the frames itself with PyAV, which it already does for the embedding pass.

Both heavy seams — the frame decode and the model — are monkeypatched here, so
the suite runs with neither PyAV nor torch.
