/* Pinokio start script — runs the Flask server as a Pinokio daemon.

   The URL is READ BACK from the terminal instead of being hardcoded: port 5050
   is a default, not a promise (backend/run.py advances to the next free port
   when something else already holds it), so `local.set url` uses whatever
   Werkzeug reports it bound. That is what fills the "Open Web UI" tab.

   Environment:
   - LDS_PORT=5050    same default as start.bat (5000 collides constantly).
   - LDS_NO_REEXEC=1  backend/run.py re-execs itself into a `.venv/` sitting
                      next to it when it finds one. Under Pinokio the pinned
                      interpreter is the `env/` venv Pinokio just activated, so
                      a `.venv/` left behind by an earlier start.bat run in the
                      same folder must not hijack the launch.
   - LDS_OPEN_BROWSER is intentionally NOT set: Pinokio opens the app itself.
   - LDS_NO_BROWSER=1  and on this fork that is not enough on its own. Here
                      `server.auto_open_browser` DEFAULTS to true, so run.py
                      would pop a system browser alongside Pinokio's own Open
                      Web UI tab. Not setting a variable only withholds a
                      request; this one withdraws it. */
