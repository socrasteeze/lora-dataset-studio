"""Enforce what a published release may contain: no EXE, and no personal data.

With no argument, this checks every workflow that can publish a GitHub release.
Paths passed on the command line are inspected too; ZIP members are read
without extracting them. The release workflow and CI both invoke this script.

WHY THE ARCHIVE AND NOT THE REPO. `backend/tests/test_no_personal_data.py`
guards the sources, but it walks `git ls-files` and skips `frontend/dist/`, so
it is blind to three things at once: untracked files, ignored files, and the
compiled bundle everybody actually downloads. That blindness has already cost
something — a published release carried `backend/.pytest_cache/`, because the
packaging script excluded `tests` but not the cache directory beside it.

Reading the final ZIP closes all three holes in one pass, because the ZIP is
the artifact, not a proxy for it. The patterns are imported from
`scripts/privacy_patterns.py`, never copied: two tables that drift apart are
worse than one table.

# beyond the one string it was written for.
#
# It is EMPTY, and that is a measured result, not an oversight: a real build of
# the current bundle scans 189 of its 189 files — minified JS, CSS, LICENSE and
# all — and produces zero findings. Two shapes people expect to see here do not
# need an entry, and adding one would be wrong:
#   * the UI placeholders `C:\path\to\...`, `C:\ComfyUI`, `C:\ai-toolkit` — the
#     Windows-path pattern only fires on a `…:\Users\<account>` path, because a
#     drive letter plus a generic folder identifies nobody;
#   * help text starting with `Examples:` — it is prose, matching nothing.
# Token-shaped strings that spell out that they are fake (`hf_…LEAKED…`, a
# placeholder someone is meant to overwrite) are handled once, for every
# scanner, by FAKE_SECRET_HINTS in privacy_patterns.py.
#
# If a release ever fails here, the first question is whether the string really
# is harmless. Only then add an entry, with a comment saying why.
