# Settings reference

Every setting in LoRA Dataset Studio, explained: what it does, its default, when to change it, and the traps to avoid.

## How settings work

Open **Settings** from the top nav. Each rail entry on the left is a section (Overview, Image engines, Scraping & sources, Local tools, Captioning & quality, Training, Server & access, Maintenance); its little LED shows live health at a glance — **green** when the section is fully configured, **amber** when it's partly set up, **off** when nothing is configured yet.

A few things hold true everywhere:

- **Nothing saves until you say so.** Change any field and a floating **Unsaved changes** bar appears with **Save** and **Discard**. Navigate away with changes pending and they're kept in the bar, not written.
- **Where values live.** Ordinary settings are written to `config.json` (git-ignored, in your data directory). Secrets — API keys and tokens — go to a separate `.env` file and are never written to `config.json` or committed.
- **Secret fields are write-only.** An API-key box is always blank, even when a key is saved (a ✓ *Configured* badge tells you it's there). Typing a new value replaces the old one; **leaving a field blank never erases a saved key** — that would be too easy to do by accident. To actually remove a key, use its **Remove** button.
- **Test buttons probe what's saved, not what's typed.** Hitting **Test** first persists whatever you've typed, then tests the *saved* setting end-to-end. So a Test result always reflects the value the app will really use.
- **Server changes need a restart.** Host, port and the access token only take effect when the server process starts. Those fields show a **Running vs Saved** comparison and a **Save & restart to apply** button. Everything else — including scraping credentials — applies immediately, no restart.
- **Every field can go back to its shipped value.** Change a number, a path, a dropdown or the enabled-engine list and a small **↺ Reset to default** button appears right under it; it disappears again once the field is back where it started, so a button you can see is always a button that does something. The value it restores is read from the server, not from a copy inside the page — so if a shipped default changes in a later release, Reset gives you the *new* default rather than the one your version was built with. On the fields that mean "work it out yourself" when left blank (the engine model slugs, the Krea base model, the dataset images root), Reset empties the box rather than typing today's answer in, which is how you keep following future improvements instead of freezing one. Nothing is written until you **Save**, same as any other edit.
- **Search finds settings, not just sections.** The search box at the top of the page matches both section names *and* individual settings, so typing "budget" or "vision model" jumps you straight to the right field.

### Advanced: environment overrides

For containerized or scripted setups, a handful of environment variables override paths and binds before `config.json` is even read. You rarely need these — the UI covers the normal cases.

| Variable | Overrides |
|---|---|
| `LDS_DATA_DIR` | Runtime data directory (where `config.json`, datasets and trash live). |
| `LDS_CONFIG` | Path to `config.json`. |
| `LDS_ENV` | Path to the `.env` secrets file. |
| `LDS_HOST` | Bind host — takes priority over `server.host`. |
| `LDS_PORT` | Bind port — takes priority over `server.port`. |
| `LDS_NO_BROWSER` | `1` disables the browser auto-open at startup regardless of `server.auto_open_browser` — for a one-off or automated launch that never touched Settings. |
| `LDS_CONSOLE` | Overrides `console.level` for this process (`off` / `events` / `heartbeat` / `all`) — terminal activity stream verbosity without editing `config.json`. |
| `LDS_DB_TRACE` | Overrides `diagnostics.db_trace_seconds` for this process. Seconds a database write may be held before it is reported to the log; unset or `0` = off. Set it to `2` when the app goes unresponsive while a pass runs — the log then names the thread holding the database and the statement that opened the write. |
| `LDS_SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` | How long a click waits for the database before giving up (default `15000`). Only worth changing while hunting a stall: at `500` a misbehaving background pass surfaces in seconds instead of being absorbed by the wait. Leaving it low makes ordinary clicks fail during normal batch saves. |
| `LDS_PUBLIC` | Set to `1` when the app is served on a URL the public internet can reach (a rented GPU box's proxy hostname, a tunnel). Forces the access-token gate on whatever `server.require_token` says, and makes the launcher generate a token if none exists. Only affects non-loopback binds. |
| `LDS_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED` | Set to `1` to deliberately opt out of the token gate — for setups that already authenticate the connection themselves (a VPN, a reverse proxy that requires its own login, a trusted Docker network). Overrides `LDS_PUBLIC`: with this set, a public bind is served with no token check at all. |
| `LDS_EXTENSIONS` | Set to `0` to disable the local extension loader entirely — no package under the extensions directory is imported. See the [Extensions guide](extensions.md). |
| `LDS_EXTENSIONS_DIR` | Directory the extension loader scans (default `backend/extensions/`, which is gitignored and never ships). Mostly for tests and unusual layouts. |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `1` enables Flask debug mode. |

## Overview

The Overview section has **no settings of its own** — it's the at-a-glance dashboard for the rest of the page. If nothing is configured yet, it opens with a *Let's get you set up* banner. Below that, a **Capabilities** grid marks each feature ✓ or ✗ depending on what the app can currently see (a key, a reachable tool, an installed extra).

Every row is a **link to the control that turns that capability on**, not just to the right screen: picking *Person masks* opens the Setup wizard step that installs it. Use the grid as your first stop to answer "why is this feature greyed out?" — the answer is one click away on the row itself.

A row marked **◐ in amber** is not broken: the tool is installed, it just isn't running (typically *launch ComfyUI to enable* for Klein and the Test Studio). Those rows lead to the **ComfyUI API URL** field and its **Test** button rather than to an install you have already done. The counter at the top reads `X/11 ready` plus, when it applies, how many are waiting on a process.

If nothing on the grid tells you where to start, the line at the bottom opens the **Setup wizard**, which scans the machine and installs what it can.

## Image engines

This fork generates exclusively on **local** engines, both running through ComfyUI — free, private, NSFW-capable. There are two: **Klein**, the historical one, and **Krea 2 Edit**, which re-stages your reference photo while holding the identity from that one photo alone (no character LoRA needed). The former cloud API engines (Nano Banana / ChatGPT / OpenRouter) were removed: there are no engine API keys and no subscription login. **Which engines to offer** below picks which of the two appear in the generate panel and which one is preselected. ComfyUI itself is configured under **Local tools**; the model weights install from the **Setup** page.

### Which engines to offer

- **Default engine** → `engines.default`. The engine preselected in the workspace. Default **`klein`**.
- **Enabled engines** → `engines.enabled`. Which engines appear as cards in the generate panel. Default **`['klein', 'krea']`**. Both are free local GPU passes, so this is about what you actually have installed — Krea 2 Edit needs its own custom-node pack and four model files, and its card names whatever is still missing.
- `engines.known` is **not a setting**: it is the ledger of which engines the app was offering the last time you saved this list, and it is what tells "this engine did not exist yet" apart from "I unticked it on purpose". Written automatically; `[]` or absent means the app assumes Klein was the only engine on offer — which is what makes Krea 2 Edit reach installs that had already saved their Settings. Delete it to be re-offered every engine.

### Krea 2 Edit (local)

The second local engine. Where Klein *restages* your reference with a general instruction-edit model, **Krea 2 Identity Edit** is trained specifically to keep an identity: from a **single** reference photo it holds the face, the body and the permanent markings while changing the angle, framing, light, background and clothes — **with no character LoRA**. That is what makes it useful *before* a LoRA exists, which is the whole point of building a dataset.

It is not installed by the app. It needs, inside your own ComfyUI:

- the **[comfyui-krea2edit](https://github.com/lbouaraba/comfyui-krea2edit)** custom-node pack in `custom_nodes/` (no Python dependencies), then a ComfyUI restart;
- a **Krea 2 Raw or Turbo** base model under a `krea`-named folder in `models/diffusion_models` (or `models/unet`) — from [Comfy-Org/Krea-2 ▸ diffusion_models](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Krea-2/tree/main/diffusion_models) (public, no account needed; `krea2_turbo_fp8_scaled.safetensors` is the usual pick);
- the **Krea 2 Identity Edit LoRA** in `models/loras` — from [Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/2761113);
- the **Qwen3-VL 4B** text encoder in `models/text_encoders` and the **Qwen Image VAE** in `models/vae` — both from the same [Comfy-Org/Krea-2](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Krea-2) repo, under `text_encoders/` and `vae/`. Keep the filenames as published: `qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled.safetensors` and `qwen_image_vae.safetensors`. The other Qwen encoders (`qwen_2.5_vl_*`, `qwen_3_8b_*`) belong to different models and are deliberately never picked up here.

The engine card in the workspace names whichever of these is still missing, one actionable line at a time, and the app never guesses a download URL for weights it cannot verify. Every path above is found by *searching* your ComfyUI model roots — including any `extra_model_paths.yaml` roots — so a non-standard layout works untouched.

Settings. The **four calibration dials** below (reference grounding, sampler steps, reference pull, identity LoRA strength) are editable **both here and in the 🧬 Krea 2 Edit tuning panel** of the workspace's *Generate variations* screen — same key, same endpoint, one value: whichever slider you move, the other screen shows the new number and every future Krea run uses it. The two **file-path** fields are on this page only, because they are filled once at install rather than adjusted while judging an image.

- **Reference grounding** → `krea.grounding_px`. Range `512`–`1536`, default **`1024`**. **The** dial of this engine: the resolution your reference is shown to the model's vision encoder at. At the low end it follows the shot description (more variety in pose, outfit and scene, looser likeness); **higher** values favor reference likeness and can copy the very pose and outfit you asked it to change. **1024 is the identity-first profile** shipped since the v4 calibration, paired with reference pull `4.0` — the two always ship together. **Lower it to `512` when you want variety more than likeness**: that was the v3 default, and it keeps the prompt and the selected catalog card more firmly in charge. This is Krea-only: it does not change Klein.
- **Sampler steps** → `krea.steps`. Range `1`–`50`, default **`12`**. This base is guidance-distilled, so more steps mostly buy waiting; `8` — the value the model's own reference workflow uses, and the v3 default — remains a perfectly good choice and renders faster. `12` ships because it is the value the v4 calibration was measured at, not because 8 was found wanting. *(This line said "default 10" for a while, then "8"; the shipped default is now 12.)*
- **Base model file** → `krea.base_model`. **This is the GENERATION setting only** — the checkpoint ComfyUI loads for Krea 2 Identity Edit. It has **nothing to do with LoRA training**, which never reads it: training pulls its base from Hugging Face and picks it from the **Krea 2 training base** dropdown in the training panel (**Raw**, the default and the official recommendation — you train on Raw and apply the LoRA on Turbo at inference). Nobody can accidentally train on Turbo by leaving this field alone. *(The naming confusion was raised by strouder, GitHub #19.)* Blank (default) = the app picks a Krea 2 **Turbo** then **Raw** build from your ComfyUI. Set it only if you own several. A **bare filename is enough** — it is matched against every `krea`-named folder under your diffusion-model roots, **at any depth**, so a build filed in `unet/Krea/archive/` resolves like one sitting directly in `unet/Krea/`. (Until 2026-08-22 that search stopped one level down, so a deeper file was reported as "not on disk" and the engine refused to run.) When two files share a name, the shallower one wins. Checkpoints that merely carry "krea" in their name but are not Krea 2 bases are **skipped on purpose** — the identity LoRA renders pure noise on them, which looks like a broken app rather than a wrong file. The field is a **searchable list of the Krea bases actually on disk** — the same candidates the app itself would elect, so a checkpoint it refuses is never offered; you can still type a name for a file you have not downloaded yet. **A name that is not on disk stops the engine** rather than falling back to automatic election: this exact fallback once had a whole training run on a third-party finetune nobody chose, because the field showed one file and the graph loaded another. **When the field is blank, the line under it names the build your runs actually load** — with two Krea checkpoints whose filenames both read as "turbo", the tie-break used to pick one silently, and the only way to find out was reading a finished PNG's metadata, long after the quality judgements had been made on a model nobody chose. The name is resolved server-side by the same code the generation path calls, never re-ranked in the browser. Clear the field to go back to automatic detection.
- **Identity edit LoRA** → `krea.identity_lora`. A searchable list of the LoRAs on disk (typing a path still works). At its **shipped default** — the canonical download name, which nobody typed — nothing is there under that name means the app searches your LoRA folders for a `krea2_identity_edit` file, so a renamed download still works. **A name you chose yourself and that is not on disk stops the engine instead**, naming the file: the identity LoRA *is* the face transfer, and quietly substituting another one changes every image you generate. Clear the field to return to the automatic search.
- **Krea 2 Edit generation LoRA presets** → `krea.generation_lora_presets`. Named,
  ordered combinations of **your own** LoRA files, chained after the identity-edit
  LoRA when Krea 2 Edit generates dataset images. Max 8 LoRAs per preset, 12
  presets; inside a preset the row order **is** the chain order. Per run you pick
  one preset in the workspace's 🧬 Krea 2 Edit tuning panel — which opens on
  **Preset selected by default** → `krea.default_generation_lora_preset` (default:
  empty = *None*), a starting point you can override for a single run without
  rewriting the setting — the run sends only the preset's NAME and the app resolves
  the files from this list, so renaming a preset can never make a run load
  something you didn't configure. Strength runs to 6, and to **20** for utility
  LoRAs whose filename says `filter-bypass`: those have no measurable effect below
  about 10. Limits worth knowing: the LoRA must be trained for **Krea 2** (another
  architecture loads as a silent no-op — the picker badges it), only the **model**
  side is patched so a LoRA's text-encoder weights are ignored, a row whose file
  has moved is **skipped** with the rest of the chain still applied, and the 🔄
  single-image regenerate in the workspace does **not** carry a preset. A row
  pointing at the **same file as Identity edit LoRA** is skipped too — it would
  chain the identity LoRA a second time on top of itself, summing both strengths
  into one delta well past what the file was trained for (visible as blocky,
  posterized output, not a subtler quality loss) — **the preset editor flags that
  row as you write it** rather than leaving the only trace in the server log, and
  it compares paths the way the server does, so a different separator or
  capitalisation cannot dodge the warning. Empty by default. *(Preset
  mechanism by @waltm, Discord.)*

Two more Krea calibration dials, on this page **and** in the **🧬 Krea 2 Edit tuning** panel of the workspace's *Generate variations* screen — that panel is where you judge what they do, so it is where you should be able to turn them. They were reachable only from there for a while, and reference grounding only from here, which meant "where do I change this?" had a different answer per dial. They are settings either way: moving a slider on either screen saves the value globally and it applies to **every** Krea run from now on. The panel says so above the sliders.

- **Reference pull** → `krea.ref_boost`. Range `0`–`10`, default **`4.0`**. How hard the source latent is pushed back into the model at every denoising step. This is the lever for *"the subject doesn't look enough like my reference"* — raise it and likeness sharpens; raise it far and the model also recopies the composition, pose and outfit the shot card asked it to change. It ships **paired** with `grounding_px` and always has (v1 = 1024 / 4.0, v2 = 512 / 1.0, v3 = 512 / 0.25, **v4 = 1024 / 4.0**), so moving one dial alone puts you on a combination no shipped profile ever calibrated — this is the dial that brings the pair back into balance. **What the v4 default rests on, stated so you can judge it:** a benchmark on a single reference, four scored images per profile, where 1024 / 4.0 led by +0.17 face similarity on bust framing with no overlap between runs — and did so at a *lower* pull than the setup it beat, so the extra likeness was not bought by recopying. Face-framing cards were dominated by seed noise and measured nothing; body framings produced no face score at all. It is a deliberate choice for identity over variety, not a proven optimum.
- **Identity LoRA strength** → `krea.identity_lora_strength`. Range `0`–`1.5`, default **`1.0`**. The weight applied to the Krea 2 identity-edit LoRA itself — the piece that carries the face across. Below 1 softens the likeness and leaves more room for the prompt; `0` disables the face transfer entirely; above 1 is past the weight the file was trained for and can look waxy or posterized rather than simply more similar.

Both are re-clamped by the server on every run, so a hand-edited `config.json` out of range is corrected rather than obeyed.

Two behaviours worth knowing before you build a dataset with it:

- **The selected card's framing is honored.** Krea Fit v1.2 uses the selected catalog card's framing and aspect ratio (including its 1:1 / 3:4 shape) instead of copying the source photo's shape.
- **The dataset's extra reference images are never used by Krea** — not when generating variations, and not when editing. Klein is the local engine that reads those extra angles to strengthen identity.
  **Krea's one spare slot lives in the ✦ Edit reference dialog instead.** Add an image there with **+** and it becomes the second input of that single edit. The edit model was trained on two-input edits where the second image is a *different* subject — another person, or a scene to place yours in ("scene first, subject second"). So use it to compose: *"put her in this room"*, *"next to this person"*. Another angle of the same face is off-label there and can come back duplicated, which is exactly why that slot is not wired to the dataset's angles.

Outfits and expressions are steered differently here than on the other engines: this model preserves anything it is not *positively* told to change, so the catalog's "a different outfit (not the one in the reference)" phrasing is rewritten at generation time into a concrete garment ("wearing a red knit sweater"), picked from the shot's own name — so outfits genuinely differ across the dataset while regenerating one shot reproduces its own.

### SeedVR2 upscaling (local)

*Requested by SurpassHR ([GitHub #32](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/issues/32)).*

The **fidelity** half of ✨ Upscale & improve. The two passes are a choice, not two qualities of the same thing:

| | what it does | when you want it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Klein** | re-renders detail and texture from a prompt | a genuinely soft or low-detail photo you are willing to see changed |
| **SeedVR2** | resolves detail at a higher resolution, content untouched | the frame is right and you only want it sharper — the exact skin tone, grain and colour are part of what you are training |

Both are **non-destructive**: they create a separate candidate and never touch the source file.

**What it needs** (Setup ▸ ComfyUI ▸ *SeedVR2 — optional fidelity upscaler* handles the models):

- the **[ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler](https://github.com/numz/ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler)** node pack (Apache-2.0) in ComfyUI, then a ComfyUI restart. **The app does not install this one for you**, unlike the Krea pack: it pulls thirteen Python packages that have to land in ComfyUI's own environment, and a bare copy of the folder would fail to import. Install it from ComfyUI-Manager (search "SeedVR2"), which does the dependencies properly.
- two model files in `<ComfyUI>/models/SEEDVR2` — from [numz/SeedVR2_comfyUI](https://huggingface.co/numz/SeedVR2_comfyUI) (Apache-2.0, public, no account): `seedvr2_ema_3b_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors` (3.4 GB) and `ema_vae_fp16.safetensors` (0.5 GB). The Setup card downloads both on a click; an `extra_model_paths.yaml` root for `SEEDVR2` works too.

Settings:

- **Default engine for ✨ Upscale & improve** → `improve.engine`. One of `klein`, `seedvr2`. Default **`klein`** — what every improve did before this setting existed. It governs the ✨ button on a single tile and ↻ Re-improve. **Bulk runs are never decided by it**: the selection toolbar shows one button per available engine and each states its trade-off, so a batch always says which pass it is about to run.
- **Model build** → `seedvr2.model`. Blank (default) = the app resolves it: the 3B FP8 build when present, else whatever is in the folder. Only builds **already on disk** are offered in the dropdown — the pack's loader node downloads an unknown name on first use, and a dropdown must never start a multi-gigabyte download. To use a 7B or a GGUF build, drop the file in `models/SEEDVR2` and it appears in the list. Guidance from the pack: 3B FP8 ≈ 8–12 GB VRAM, 3B FP16 ≈ 12–16, 7B FP8 ≈ 16–20, 7B FP16 ≈ 24+.
- **VAE build** → `seedvr2.vae`. Blank (default) = `ema_vae_fp16.safetensors` when it is there, else the first file in the folder whose **name** says VAE. The dropdown lists the whole `models/SEEDVR2` folder, VAE-looking files first and the rest in a second group: a pin is honoured against every file, because the automatic search already covers every install where the name is recognisable and the setting exists for the one where it is not. Picking a DiT build here fails inside the loader node.
- **Target resolution (short edge)** → `seedvr2.resolution`. Range `256`–`4096`, default **`1080`**. The **short** edge is scaled to this and the aspect ratio is kept, so 1080 on a 3:2 photo gives 1620×1080. LoRA training buckets rarely exceed 1024–1280, so higher mostly costs VRAM and time. Past what your GPU can hold in one pass the app either tiles the frame (if the tiling pack is installed) or warns you before starting — see below.
- **Maximum long edge** → `seedvr2.max_resolution`. `0` (default) = no limit. The VRAM safety valve on a wide crop: at a 1080 short edge a 4:1 panorama becomes 4320 px across.
- **Colour correction** → `seedvr2.color_correction`. One of `lab`, `wavelet`, `wavelet_adaptive`, `hsv`, `adain`, `none`. Default **`lab`** — the model's own default and the most conservative. `wavelet` holds broad tone better on heavily degraded sources; `none` shows the raw output. Colour fidelity is the reason this engine exists, so it is worth trying two modes on one image before a long batch.
- **Blocks offloaded to system RAM** → `seedvr2.blocks_to_swap`. Range `0`–`36`, default **`0`** (none, and fastest). Raise it to fit a bigger build on a smaller card: it trades speed for VRAM headroom and does not change the result.

#### Large upscales: the ceiling, and the optional tiling pack

*Contributed by [SurpassHR](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/issues/32), who hit this as a real CUDA out-of-memory on an 11.6 GB card and shipped the tiled workflow this is ported from.*

Upscaling a whole frame at once needs the whole frame in VRAM, so past a certain size it simply fails. Two things follow from that:

- **You are told the limit before a run, not after.** Setup ▸ ComfyUI shows roughly how many megapixels this GPU is good for in a single pass. It is a guide, not a gate — real headroom moves with the build, block swapping and whatever else holds VRAM, so LDS still runs what you ask for and says when it looks over budget. On a GPU it cannot see (no `nvidia-smi`, a remote ComfyUI) it says **nothing**, rather than inventing a number.
- **With the [Comfyui_TTP_Toolset](https://github.com/TTPlanetPig/Comfyui_TTP_Toolset) node pack installed (MIT), large frames are tiled**: the frame is cut into overlapping tiles (1024 px by default), each is upscaled, and the seams are blended back. Nothing *has* to be configured — the lane switches on the geometry — but the tile size and the crossover are settings when you need them (below). Install the pack in ComfyUI-Manager and restart ComfyUI; LDS detects the two node classes it needs.

Without the pack nothing breaks: upscales still run, they are just capped by the card.

- **High-resolution tiling** → `seedvr2.tiling`. One of `auto` (default), `always`, `never`. Tiling is **not only a memory trick**: SeedVR2's target resolution is the size the model actually works at, so a whole 4K frame spreads its capacity over four times the surface while a tile is upscaled in the range it is good at. SurpassHR's side-by-side on his own card showed the full-frame result losing detail and gaining artifacts where the tiled one did not — which also means the old rule (tile only when the frame would not fit) had it backwards: the bigger your GPU, the less often you got the better picture.
  - `auto` — tile once the target short edge is past ~1536 px, or when the frame would not fit anyway. This is the recommended setting and the reason the pack is worth installing.
  - `always` — tile any frame bigger than a single tile, including below that crossover.
  - `never` — always full-frame. Pick this if you ever see a seam; the VRAM warning still applies.
  On `auto` nothing is tiled **at or below** the crossover: the model is already at a comfortable size and a grid would only add seams. The crossover has to be *passed*, not just reached — a 1536 px target at the default 1024 px tile runs full-frame, and so does a 768 px one if you dropped the tile to 512. The panel says which lane your configured target will take, so that decision is never silent. The pre-#32 rule (tile *only* when the frame would not fit) is deliberately not offered — it is the default the side-by-side refuted.
- **Tile size** → `seedvr2.tile_px`. Range `512`–`2048` (snapped to a multiple of 64), default **`1024`** — the contributed value. **This is the memory dial of the engine**: a pass holds one tile at a time, so lowering it to 768 or 512 is what makes a large upscale finish on an 8 GB card, at the cost of more seams and more passes; raising it on a 24 GB card gives fewer seams and more context per tile. It also sizes the model's own **tiled VAE encode/decode**, which runs on the full-frame lane as well — so it lowers VRAM use even with no tiling pack installed. Try this before concluding a big upscale is impossible on your card.
- **Start tiling above** → `seedvr2.tile_threshold`. Short edge past which `auto` tiles, in pixels — strictly *above*, so a target equal to this value still runs full-frame. **`0`** (default) = derive it from the tile size (1.5×, i.e. the shipped 1536 px at a 1024 px tile) so the crossover follows the tile you chose. A positive value places it by hand: lower to tile sooner (safer on a small card), higher to keep more targets in a single fast pass. No effect on `always` or `never`.

 LDS ports only the tiling itself — the original workflow also chained two further node packs to do arithmetic (counting tiles, normalising a pixel count), one of them GPL-3.0, and that arithmetic is done in Python here instead.

**There is no batch-size setting, on purpose.** SeedVR2's `batch_size` is a *video* window whose frames share temporal attention to stay coherent — feeding it unrelated dataset photos would let them bleed into each other. Images are upscaled one per job; throughput comes from the normal generation queue and its fan-out cap.

### Camera angles (local)

📷 **Camera angles** re-photographs an existing picture from another camera position: open it in the 🖼 Gallery **or in a dataset**, press **Camera angles**, pick where the camera stands on the dial, how high it is and how close. The subject stays where it is and **the background moves with the camera**, so what was behind them comes into view.

**In a dataset the verb answers a different question**, so it behaves differently in one way worth knowing: the views arrive as ordinary **pending candidates** you keep or reject, and each is born with its angle phrase already in the caption ("seen from behind, low camera angle"), which the captioner completes and then re-injects on every later pass. That is deliberate — what a caption does not describe binds to the trigger word, so a back view left undescribed teaches the LoRA that the character *is* back-facing. The **Image bank does not carry the button at all**: it holds real material, and a re-shot view is plausible rather than real. Promote to a dataset first.

**This is not the shot catalog's "profile view".** That one asks an edit model for another angle and the model answers by turning the *person* — measured on this app's own Klein lane, the room behind never moved, whatever the wording. Moving the viewpoint needs a model trained on real viewpoint changes, which is why this lane runs on **Qwen-Image-Edit 2511** with fal.ai's Multiple-Angles LoRA (trained on gaussian-splatting renders, Apache-2.0) rather than on the Klein weights you already have.

**What it costs.** The base model is **~20.5 GB**, plus 295 MB for the angles LoRA and 850 MB for the optional 4-step speed LoRA. The text encoder and VAE are shared with lanes you may already have installed. **Setup ▸ Install** carries the lane properly: a one-click card (~21.6 GB all told, shared parts skipped), a repair row per weight so one broken download can be fixed alone, and a counted row on the readiness screen — a machine missing the lane reads *not ready* instead of certifying "all set" by leaving it out. Pressing 📷 with the weights absent still starts the same downloads and tells you so — nothing is fetched behind your back. Once the model is resident a view takes **12–16 s**; the first one of a session also pays for loading the model (~1 min).

**The limits, stated up front:**

- **Distance is approximate.** Close-up / medium / wide are hints the model mostly honours; several poses asked at *medium* come back tighter than the source.
- **Off-camera detail is invented.** The part of the scene the original photo never showed is plausible, not real. Fine for a character dataset, wrong for anything that has to be a faithful record of a place.
- **A camera view cannot be re-shot from another angle.** The second pass would re-invent what the first already invented and present it as the original scene, so the button is refused there and says why.
- **Up to the whole vocabulary (96 views) in one run.** The count under the button is the product of the axes you ticked; it says what the run will cost before you spend it, turns amber past about five minutes, and every queued view can be dropped one at a time from the system queue.

**Model files (optional).** Same contract as the Klein pins below — empty means auto-detect (canonical download filename first, then a narrow token scan), a value pins one file.

- **Diffusion model** → `camera.unet`. Default **empty**. Auto-detection prefers a **2511** build: the LoRA was trained on that generation and a 2509 build loads happily and quietly under-performs. This key also has a picker in the app — the **Model row of the 📷 panel** lists every qwen build on your disk (files in qwen-named folders under `diffusion_models`, plus root-level files with `qwen` in the name) and saves this same key, app-wide: pick a finetune or an NSFW merge there and every camera run uses it, on both surfaces, until you clear it back to the default. The angle grammar comes from the LoRA, so a different build changes the look, not the camera. A pinned file that later disappears is flagged in the row and the run falls back to auto-detection rather than refusing.
- **Text encoder** → `camera.text_encoder`. Default **empty**. ⚠️ `models/text_encoders` can hold **three different Qwen encoders** — Klein's `qwen_3_8b`, Z-Image/Krea's `qwen3vl_4b`, and this lane's `qwen_2.5_vl_7b`. They are not interchangeable and a wrong one fails at sampling time with a shape error, so auto-detection is deliberately narrow and pinning is how you rescue a renamed file.
- **VAE** → `camera.vae`. Default **empty**. The same file the **Krea 2 Edit** lane installs — one copy, one Setup button; this lane never downloads a second.
- **Angles LoRA** → `camera.angles_lora`. Default **empty**. **Required**: without it the base model still edits, it just answers the camera vocabulary the way any edit model does — by turning the subject. A camera view with no camera in it would look like a success, so the lane refuses to run rather than render one.
- **Speed LoRA** → `camera.speed_lora`. Default **empty**, and genuinely optional: absent, the graph raises its own step count from 4 to 20 and renders correctly, roughly five times slower. ⚠️ When the **Model row picks a build whose name says it is already distilled** (`rapid`, `lightning`, `turbo`, `aio`, `hyper`, `lcm`, `4step`…), runs **skip this LoRA and keep 4 steps** — chaining a speed LoRA onto an already-few-step merge is distillation applied twice, and it renders confetti-like patches over skin and tiles while every job reports success (measured, same seed, same pose). The picker's note says so when it applies, and **pinning a file here overrides the skip** — a pin is you saying you know better than the filename.

### Klein model files (optional)

*Contributed by socrasteeze (GitHub).* Pin the exact files the Klein graph loads instead of relying on auto-detection. Every field accepts **a full absolute path or a ComfyUI-relative loader name**; empty fields keep the default behaviour (the canonical download filename first, then a narrow token scan of the ComfyUI model folders). Each field now **lists the files actually found in that ComfyUI folder** (`extra_model_paths.yaml` roots included), with a ↻ to rescan after you drop a new file in; free text stays available because an absolute path from outside every ComfyUI root is a legitimate value no scan can enumerate.

- **Diffusion model (UNET)** → `klein.unet`. A full path, or a name relative to a diffusion-model folder — e.g. `klein/flux-2-klein-9b-fp8.safetensors` under `models/unet`, or a bare filename for a file sitting at a folder root. This is also what lets you use a UNET that does **not** live in a `klein`-named subfolder, which the automatic scan would never find. Default **empty** (auto-detect).
- **Text encoder** → `klein.text_encoder`. Full path, or relative to `models/text_encoders` — e.g. `qwen_3_8b_fp8mixed.safetensors`. Default **empty**.
- **VAE** → `klein.vae`. Full path, or relative to `models/vae` — e.g. `flux2-vae.safetensors`. Default **empty**.
- **Consistency LoRA** → `klein.consistency_lora`. Full path, or relative to `models/loras`. The structure-anchoring LoRA chained onto the Klein edit graph — this is the same key that was previously config-only. Unlike the three above it has a shipped default, so **clearing it disables the LoRA** rather than turning on auto-detection. Default `klein/Flux2-Klein-9B-consistency-V2.safetensors` (the Setup download location).

How references resolve:

- A **full path under any of ComfyUI's model folders** — including folders registered in `extra_model_paths.yaml` (the app parses it exactly like ComfyUI does) — is converted automatically to the relative loader name ComfyUI's nodes need, and the field shows **Found**. Nothing is copied or moved.
- A **full path anywhere else** — Downloads, a Hugging Face cache, another drive — is **hardlinked (or symlinked) into `<ComfyUI models>/<type>/lds-pinned/`** so stock loader nodes can open it, and shows the same **Found**. Your config keeps the original absolute path; the link is created when the reference resolves, costs no extra disk, and is reused on later runs. Staged files are deliberately *not* put in a `klein`-named folder, so they never show up as a second copy in the Klein model picker.
- A reference that **cannot be resolved** — no such file, or the link could not be created (a read-only models folder, or another volume on an account without symlink rights) — is **refused rather than substituted**, with a badge here and the file named. It used to fall back to auto-detection and only show the badge: the run then went ahead on a *different* file from the one displayed, and the only symptom arrived with the images. **Clearing the field is the explicit way back to auto-detection.**
  - **A bare file name is valid here.** The model dropdown in the workspace writes this same key and stores names *without* their folder, so `flux-2-klein-9b-fp8.safetensors` and `klein\flux-2-klein-9b-fp8.safetensors` both name the same file and both resolve. They did not always: the bare form was read as "not on disk", which meant **picking a model from the app's own menu switched the engine off**, explaining that nothing was missing. Nothing you typed was ever wrong there.
  - **An unresolvable Diffusion model does not darken the whole engine** while usable Klein builds sit on disk. That slot has a picker in the run panel, so switching the engine off removed the very control that would have repaired it — a feature announced as *optional* cannot also be a feature one missing file takes hostage. The card asks for a model instead, and the **run** refuses only if it is started without one (never by quietly loading a neighbouring file). With no Klein build on disk at all there is nothing to ask, and the engine stays off.
  - The one exception is **Consistency LoRA left at its shipped default**, which nobody chose: at that value a missing file is still simply skipped, exactly as before.
- Native / **bf16 UNETs** (a filename without `fp8`) now load with `weight_dtype: default`; FP8 builds keep `fp8_e4m3fn`. Both shipped Klein graphs hardcoded `fp8_e4m3fn`, which quantized a full-precision pin on load without saying so. The canonical download carries `fp8` in its name, so a stock install renders exactly as before.
- Generation-LoRA **preset rows** accept full paths the same way.
- **Not cleaned up automatically.** Changing or clearing a pin leaves its link behind in `lds-pinned/`; the folder is safe to delete by hand when nothing points there any more.

Traps and good-to-knows:

- The dataset's own **Klein model (per dataset)** choice still wins over `klein.unet` for that dataset's runs — the pin is what auto-detection falls back to, not an override of an explicit per-run pick.
- **This is the fix for a model the app insists is "missing" while you are looking at it.** Auto-detection is deliberately narrow (a wrong model fails at sampling time with a cryptic shape error, which is worse than a missing one), so it *declines* any file it cannot confidently name — and a declined file is reported as missing. Pinning it by name removes that discretion: the file resolves, and the integrity check then tells you the truth about it, including **"present but unreadable"** for a corrupt or half-downloaded weight, with the delete-and-re-download action attached.
- Pinning the wrong *kind* of file (e.g. another family's text encoder) is **not** validated — that generate will fail at sampling time with a shape error. The narrow auto-detection exists precisely to avoid that; only pin files you know are Klein-compatible.

### Klein generation LoRA presets (optional)

*Idea from @waltm on Discord.* Named combinations of generation LoRAs that stack on top of the local Klein edit graph. Stored in `klein.generation_lora_presets` (default: empty — no presets).

Each preset has a **name** and an **ordered list of LoRAs**, and each LoRA row has:

- a **file** — a name relative to your ComfyUI `models/loras` folder (e.g. `klein/my-lora.safetensors`), exactly like the consistency LoRA. The field is a **searchable dropdown of the LoRAs actually on disk** (every folder, `extra_model_paths.yaml` included), with Klein-compatible files listed first and each one badged by architecture; free text still works for a file you haven't downloaded yet;
- a **strength** — `0`–`1.5`, default **`0.6`**.

Use **＋ New preset**, **Duplicate**, **Delete** and rename to manage them, and the up/down controls to set chain order. **Caps: 8 LoRAs per preset, 12 presets.**

How presets are used matters:

- A preset is **chosen per run** in the **🖥️ Klein tuning** panel of the workspace. The panel opens on **Preset selected by default** → `klein.default_generation_lora_preset` (default: empty = *None*, the behaviour every install had before this key existed). That is a **starting point, not a lock**: the run panel still offers *None* and every other preset for that run, and choosing there **never rewrites the setting**. Fail-closed like the rest of the chain — a default naming a preset you have since renamed or deleted falls back to *None*, and the Settings field says so instead of pretending it is empty. Each engine has its **own** default key (`klein.default_generation_lora_preset` / `krea.default_generation_lora_preset`), because `klein.generation_lora_presets` and `krea.generation_lora_presets` are independent lists where the same name can designate two different chains.
- Resolution happens **by name** on the server, and it's **fail-closed**: if a run references a preset name that no longer exists, it runs **with no extra LoRAs** rather than erroring.
- **Trap:** *renaming* a preset does **not** follow a run that referenced it by the old name — that run silently falls back to no extra LoRAs. Rename before you queue, or re-pick the preset on the run.
- There is deliberately **no automatic NSFW gating** on individual LoRAs — the preset you pick carries the intent. If you want an "NSFW full" stack, make it a preset.
- **Trap:** a row pointing at the **same file as the consistency LoRA** (`klein.consistency_lora`) is skipped — it would chain that LoRA a second time on top of itself, summing both strengths into one delta well past what the file was trained for (visible as blocky, posterized output). **The preset editor now flags that row as you write it**, on the row itself, instead of leaving the only trace in the server log — which is how a preset holding exactly one such row produced a run with no extra LoRA and nothing on screen to explain it. The check compares paths the way the server does (separators unified, case ignored), so `klein/x.safetensors` and `klein\X.safetensors` are both caught. It does **not** claim to catch an absolute path aliasing the same file — the server still drops that row, quietly.

### Klein generation quality

*Raised by ashish.sinha.* **Generation steps** → `klein.generation_steps` (1–50, default **5**). How many sampler steps the local **Klein** engine spends on each generated image — variations, regenerations and the automatic small-image rescue. The shipped workflow had this pinned at **5** with no way to change it; the default is that same 5, so nothing moves until you raise it. More steps usually render more cleanly and cost proportionally more time (10 steps ≈ twice the wait per image).

It is a **rendering** knob, not an anatomy fix: extra limbs, tails or wrong body parts come from the identity prompt describing the wrong kind of subject (see the subject-type note below), and no number of steps repairs that.

**Enhancement LoRA on edits** → `klein.edit_base_lora_strength` (0–2, default **0**). How much of the detail LoRA (`klein/realistic.safetensors`) Klein mixes into an **edit**: the ✦ reference edit, variations, regenerations and the small-image rescue. The shipped workflow carries that LoRA at **0.8** and nothing on these lanes ever turned it down — which stayed invisible while the file existed on no install (the node was skipped), and became real once Setup started downloading it: from then on every Klein edit ran with a style LoRA at 0.8 pulling the result away from the instruction you typed. The default **0** is the render every install had before that download existed; raise it to let the LoRA add detail on purpose. “Upscale & improve” is unaffected — it has its own `klein.improve_base_lora_strength`.

Separate from **Upscale & improve ▸ Steps** (`klein.improve_steps`), which drives the manual improve pass only.

**Output size (MP)** is also editable from the improve note itself — the panel under the ✨ button — same key, same 0.5–8 bounds, app-wide like the instruction.

**LoRA preset on ✨ Upscale & improve** → `klein.improve_lora_preset` (a preset **name**, default **blank = none**). Which of your **generation LoRA presets** (the named combinations defined on this card) every Klein improve chains after the consistency LoRA. Picked from the improve note itself — the settings window the ✨ button opens (inline on the bulk toolbar), next to the instruction editor — and **app-wide like the instruction**: the single ✨, the 🔄 re-run and the whole batch all follow it, in every dataset. Fail-closed like the rest of the preset chain: a renamed or deleted preset quietly runs as **None**, never a blocked pass. **SeedVR2 is unaffected** — a restoration chains no LoRA. The improved image records the LoRAs that actually ran in its details, so a render never claims a preset it did not use.

### Variation output size (both local engines)

Not in Settings — it sits at the top of the **Generate variations** panel, above the shot cards, whenever a local engine is selected. **Output size (MP)** → `variations.output_megapixels` (0.5–2.0, default **2.0**).

It is **one dial for both local engines**, on purpose. Before it existed the two disagreed: **Klein** rendered every shot at a hardcoded 2 MP *in the reference photo's shape*, while **Krea 2 Edit** used the shot card's shape but never spent more pixels than the reference itself held — so a 1024×832 reference gave you 0.84 MP Krea tiles next to 2 MP Klein ones, in different shapes, in the same dataset, with nothing on screen explaining either number.

Now both engines spend this budget on **the shot card's ratio**: pick 2.0 and a portrait card renders at 1216 × 1632, a square one at 1408 × 1408, a 16:9 one at 1872 × 1056. Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Klein no longer follows the reference photo's shape.** A card that says 16:9 gets 16:9, whatever your reference is. That is the point — a dataset's framing should come from the shots you picked, not from how you happened to crop one photo.
- **The dial wins even above the reference's own pixel count.** Asking for 2 MP from a 0.85 MP reference genuinely renders 2 MP; the model paints the extra pixels rather than resampling them. It is a generation, not a copy — but do not expect detail your reference never had.

Lower it for a shorter wait and less VRAM per image (0.5 MP renders visibly softer shots, fine for a quick trial run). **2.0 is the ceiling** because the Flux edit models lose coherence past roughly that; to go bigger, generate at 2.0 and then run ✨ **Upscale & improve**, which has its own separate budget (`klein.improve_megapixels`, up to 8 MP).

Unaffected: the ✦ reference edit (no shot card, so it keeps your source's exact frame and is never upscaled) and the three API engines, which are billed per image and framed by their provider.

### Klein model (per dataset)

Not in Settings — it lives on the **dataset**, in the *Klein tuning* block of the generation panel and next to the ✨ **Upscale & improve** action itself. One setting, deliberately: generation and improve drive the same loader in the same workflow, so two near-identical model dropdowns would only be a lasting source of confusion. If you ever need to improve with a heavier model than the one you generate with, say so — splitting one stored value into two is additive; merging two back into one would have to throw one of your answers away.

**Default is Auto**, and Auto is exactly what every dataset did before this setting existed: Studio resolves the model itself (the canonical download first, then the first loadable Klein file it finds). Choosing nothing changes nothing.

**The list is detected, never typed.** It comes from the same scan ComfyUI itself would do — `models/unet`, `models/diffusion_models`, every root declared in `extra_model_paths.yaml`, and a relocated models folder (`comfyui.models_dir`) — in a `klein`-named subfolder **or** loose at the root. The one real constraint is that the model must be *nameable* as Klein: either the file name or its folder name has to contain `klein`. See *Where the Klein model can live* in the README.

**What it applies to:** every piece of Klein work that dataset starts — the single ✨ improve, the 🔄✨ re-run, the whole improve batch, Klein generation (variations and regenerations), the **reference edit** on the Klein engine, the **rescue of scraped images under 768 px**, and the **🧽 watermark clean** on the Klein engine (bulk and per-image).

**The one exception is a bank**, which has no dataset and therefore nothing to inherit: its 🧽 Klein inpaint resolves the model automatically, and the panel says which one. Naming the model and choosing it are separate questions — a bank can be told, it just has nowhere to store an answer.

**When there is only one model**, the picker does not appear — there is no choice to make — but the line naming the model still does. Not knowing which model produced an image was the actual complaint; a dropdown with one option was never the answer.

**If the model you chose is later moved or deleted**, the run **refuses by name** and tells you which file is gone. It does not quietly fall back to another model: that swap produces a result that looks perfectly fine and is not the one you asked for.

**Coming from an older version:** the generation picker used to save to your **browser** (`editPage_flux2KleinModel_v1`), which improve never read — that is why improve had no model option anywhere. That browser value is still honoured for generation and is now offered, once, to be saved onto the dataset. Nothing is adopted behind your back: until you accept, improve keeps resolving Auto exactly as before.

### Identity, Klein & Krea 2 prompts (advanced)

*Feature request by @bbsorry (雨田壹).* Every generated variation is prefixed by a hidden **identity lock** — a block of text that tells the engine to keep the subject's exact identity and take the pose and setting from the description, not the reference photo. These used to be baked in and invisible; now you can read and edit them. They are stored under `identity_prompts.*`.

**One set per subject type.** *(Reported by ashish.sinha.)* The three identity locks are scoped to the dataset's **subject type** — Human, Animal, Creature, Object, Other, Anime. Pick the type with the chips at the top of the card; a small dot marks every type you have already customised. A prompt you write for Animal applies to **animal datasets only** and never to a human one. Before this, the override was one global text: someone who adapted it for animals then saw their human variations come back with tails, extra limbs and odd footwear.

Storage follows that split, and nothing was renamed or migrated: the **Human** overrides stay on the original flat keys (`identity_prompts.face_single`, `.face_multi`, `.klein_identity`), which is where every override written before this change was stored, so yours keeps applying to your human datasets. The other types live under `identity_prompts.by_subject.<type>.<kind>` and never fall back to the flat key. `identity_prompts.klein_improve` and its toggle stay **global** on purpose — "add texture and detail" means the same thing for a person, a dog or a car. **It does not mean the same thing for a drawing**, and that is a known rough edge: the shipped text asks for photographic detail, so on an **Anime** dataset the improve pass works against the very art style every other prompt in the app protects. Until that is settled, edit the box (or turn it off) for drawn datasets — see *Troubleshooting → "Upscale & improve" makes my anime look realistic*.

> If you had adapted the identity prompt for a non-human subject before this change, your text is now sitting in the **Human** set (that is where it was saved). Open the card, check the Human boxes, and move the text to the right subject type — nothing was discarded.

**One box, already filled.** Each prompt is a **single editable box that already contains the exact text in use** — the built-in default when you have not overridden it. Put your cursor in it and change a word; there is no "load the default first" step, and no second read-only copy of the text below (the old two-box layout is gone).

**Nothing is stored while you match the default.** As long as the box still holds the built-in text (surrounding whitespace ignored), the setting is saved as **blank**, which is what makes *blank = use the shipped default* work. This is not cosmetic: if merely opening a prompt persisted a **copy** of it, you would be pinned to that wording forever and every later improvement to the built-in prompt would stop reaching you, silently. The line under the box always tells you which state you are in — *Following the built-in default* or *Custom override*. **Reset to default** appears only in the second case and clears the value back to blank.

**Reproducibility guarantee:** with nothing overridden, generation is **byte-identical** to before this setting existed — you only change behaviour if you deliberately edit the text away from the default.

**Edit the improve instruction from the ✨ button itself.** `identity_prompts.klein_improve` is the one prompt on this card you never have to come here for: the improve note carries **✎ Edit this instruction here**, which opens the same box and the same on/off tick in place. In the dataset and generated-image lightboxes that note is the settings screen of the **window the ✨ button opens** (press ✨, read, edit, then **Generate**); on the bulk toolbar it stays inline, because a batch shows its instruction before launching a lot. It edits **this setting** — there is no per-image and no per-run copy, so what you write there is what this card shows and what every later improve sends, in every dataset. The panel says that in as many words before you type, because a control sitting inside one dataset's screen otherwise reads as belonging to that dataset. The rest of the contract is identical to the box here: the field is pre-filled with the text actually in force, text matching the built-in default is stored as blank, **Reset to default** shows up only once you really have an override, and edits save as you type (the last keystroke is saved even if you close the lightbox on it). What is *not* duplicated there, on purpose: the per-subject identity locks, the other prompt parts and the four strength knobs — the note links here for those.

**Shortcut from the workspace.** The multi-reference instruction is also reachable from **Add images ▸ Extra refs ▸ ✎**, without opening Settings. That modal shows **both** `identity_prompts.face_multi` and `identity_prompts.klein_identity` — the shared config carries both keys — but this fork ships no API engine, so only `klein_identity` ever drives a generation here, and it is the one badged. It edits the prompts of the **open dataset's subject type**, and says which one in its title and intro; edits made there are the same settings as here, for that subject.

- **Local engines — restage & face-identity block** → `identity_prompts.klein_identity`. The instruction block **both** local engines — **Klein** and **Krea 2 Edit** — use to restage the shot (pose, framing, outfit, expression) while keeping the face identical. They share one prompt assembly, so this single text drives them both; it was labelled "Klein" until a user asked on Discord whether it reached Krea 2 at all. This is the only identity prompt shown in Settings — the `face_single`/`face_multi` keys exist in the shared config for the removed cloud engines and are not surfaced here.
- **Klein upscale & improve prompt** → `identity_prompts.klein_improve`, with an on/off toggle `identity_prompts.klein_improve_enabled` (default **on**). The fixed instruction the manual **Klein upscale & improve** action sends to add texture and detail. The shipped text is `add detailed texture, add sharp details, add candid shot, add soft focus effect` — read it before you blame the model: those four clauses describe a **photograph**, and they are applied to every dataset, drawn ones included. **Turn the toggle off** to run that action with **no prompt at all** — a pure upscale with no added styling. Both the text in force and these two levers are now quoted **and editable** from the ✨ **Upscale & improve** button itself (the settings window it opens in the lightboxes, the inline note on the bulk toolbar) — see *Edit the improve instruction from the ✨ button itself* above — so you no longer have to know this setting exists to find it, nor leave your images to fix it.
- **Upscale & improve — strength** → `klein.improve_megapixels`, `klein.improve_base_lora_strength`, `klein.improve_consistency_strength`, `klein.improve_steps`. The output resolution, and how much that pass is allowed to change the image. Until these were exposed the whole profile was hardcoded — **both LoRA strengths pinned to 0**, so the *enhancement* LoRA baked into the workflow never applied at all, and the size was fixed at 2 MP whatever the source was worth. Defaults are those same historical values (**2 MP / 0 / 0 / 4 steps**), so leaving them alone keeps today's result exactly. These are read at each run, so to try a new value on an image you already improved, use the **🔄✨** button on that tile: it re-runs the pass on the same source image with the settings as they are now, and replaces the result in place. (The ordinary 🔄 stays hidden there — it would restart from the dataset's reference photo and make an unrelated image.)
  - **Output size (MP)** (0.5–8, default **2**) — the source is rescaled to this pixel budget before sampling, so it *is* the result's resolution. This is the knob that makes "Upscale" actually upscale.
  - **Enhancement LoRA** (0–2, default **0**) — the workflow's own detail LoRA. At 0 it does nothing; try **0.5–0.8**. It needs its weights file (`klein/realistic.safetensors`): when that file is missing the node is skipped entirely and this value changes nothing. **Setup ▸ Install everything downloads it** with the other Klein assets (from [dx8152/Flux2-Klein-9B-Enhanced-Details](https://huggingface.co/dx8152/Flux2-Klein-9B-Enhanced-Details), Apache-2.0) — run it first if the slider seems inert.
  - **Consistency LoRA** (0–1.5, default **1**) — anchors the **composition and background**, not identity. Deliberately high here: an improve pass should add detail *without* redrawing the shot, so the resistance to editing that makes 0.8–1.0 a poor choice for restaging is exactly what you want. (Shipped briefly as `improve_character_lora_strength`, a misnomer; a value saved under that name is still honoured.)
  - **Steps** (1–50, default **4**) — more steps is slower and usually cleaner.
  - Out-of-range or malformed values are **clamped**, never rejected: a bad config weakens the pass instead of failing your click.
  - **A strength you raised is never silently dropped.** If a LoRA's weights file is missing while its strength is above 0, the pass reports the missing asset (which is what triggers its download) instead of running without it and leaving you to wonder why nothing changed. At strength 0 it stays a quiet skip — nothing is lost by not loading a LoRA you did not ask for.

Each field is a plain textarea; there's no Test button — you see the effect on your next generation. If an override ever makes results worse, hit **Restore default**.

### The rest of the prompt (Klein & Krea)

The identity lock is only **one of six** sources a local-edit prompt is assembled from. The other five shipped hardcoded and invisible until this wave — including the one that caused a live incident, where a hold order that *listed* what to preserve ("tattoos, scars, moles…") had the model painting tattoos on subjects who have none. All of them follow the same contract as the locks above: **blank means the shipped default**, non-blank wins, **Restore default** on every box.

Two of them follow the **subject type** chips, because their text genuinely differs per type:

- **Rendering tail (SFW)** → `identity_prompts.render_tail_sfw`. The last thing Klein and Krea read on a safe-for-work shot: the medium and the clamp. For photographic subjects this is `Professional realistic photograph, SFW.`; for **Anime** it asks the model to stay a drawing in the reference's art style.
- **Rendering tail (uncensored)** → `identity_prompts.render_tail_nsfw`. The same position on an uncensored shot: the SFW clamp is dropped and anatomically correct forms are requested. Only the **local** engines ever see it — the API engines refuse this content.
- **Shot detail per framing** → `identity_prompts.framing_face` / `.framing_bust` / `.framing_body` / `.framing_back`. Klein and Krea under-fill a short tag prompt and invent the rest, so each shot carries a concrete description of the framing — this is where "85mm portrait lens look" and "the ENTIRE body visible from head to toe" live. If your full-body shots keep coming back cropped, this is the box.

Non-human overrides for those six live under `identity_prompts.by_subject.<type>.<kind>` like the locks; Human keeps the flat key.

Four more are **global** — one text for every subject type, because they have no per-subject meaning (the two directives are only ever injected into human shots):

- **Hold the skin (Krea)** → `identity_prompts.markings_lock`. Sent with every Krea prompt: it forbids adding marks to the skin, and forbids redrawing, restyling, moving or removing the ones the reference already has. ⚠️ **This is the delicate one.** Naming a body feature in this box is enough to make the model paint it — that is exactly what the first version did. Describe what *not* to do, without naming a single feature.
- **Outfit directive** → `identity_prompts.outfit_vary`. Added to every human shot that does not already name a garment, so clothing comes from the description instead of being copied off the reference (which teaches the LoRA that the person owns one outfit). Note that **Krea replaces it** with a concrete garment from the palette below, so editing this text does not change what Krea sends.
- **Expression directive** → `identity_prompts.expression_neutral`. Added to every human shot that does not already name an expression, so the reference's smile does not ride on all 40 variations.
- **Concrete garments** → `identity_prompts.outfit_palette`, **one garment per line**. Krea preserves anything it is not positively ordered to change, so "a different outfit" is a no-op on it; each shot is handed a real garment from this list instead. ⚠️ The garment is chosen from the shot's name **by position in the list**, so **adding or removing a line reshuffles which garment every shot gets** — same shots, different clothes. Editing the wording of one line only affects that line. Clear the box entirely to go back to the shipped list (an empty list never produces a prompt with no outfit in it).

Both directives are baked into the shot catalog and **stored** with each variation, so the override is applied when the prompt is sent rather than when the shot is created — which means an edit reaches datasets you built **before** you made it, on their next generation.

### What actually gets sent

At the bottom of the card, a live preview of the **composed** prompt: pick an engine, a framing and SFW/uncensored, and it shows the full ~1000 characters a real catalog shot would be sent, assembled from every box on the card, **including edits you have not saved yet**. It is composed by the server through the same functions generation uses, so it cannot drift from reality — and it generates nothing: no model is loaded, no GPU is touched, nothing is billed.

It is also the fastest way to answer "why did it do *that*": read the prompt, find the sentence, edit the box it came from.

## Scraping & sources

Credentials for the built-in web scraper. **All of these apply immediately — no restart** — because sources read their key at request time.

### Source credentials

None of these has a Test button; you find out they work on your next scan.

- **Reddit client ID** → `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` (secret). Optional. Reddit scans work out of the box using a shared public client ID, but that ID is rate-limited across everyone who uses it, so you can hit *"rate limiting requests, retry in Ns"* (429) before your first scan of the day. Your own free ID gives you a private quota and clears those. **Trap:** on reddit.com/prefs/apps, create the app as type **installed app** — a *web app* or *script* comes with a client secret, and Reddit then rejects the anonymous login this app uses (every scan fails with **401**). The field has a built-in step-by-step guide.
- **Civitai API key** → `CIVITAI_API_KEY` (secret). Optional. Without it, Civitai scans return **SFW results only**; add a key to reach adult content you're entitled to use.
- **Pexels API key (required for Pexels)** → `PEXELS_API_KEY` (secret). **Required** for any Pexels search — there's no shared fallback. The free quota is **200 requests/hour and 20,000/month**. [Create one here](https://www.pexels.com/api/key/). Note the standing warning: an API key alone does **not** authorize dataset or machine-learning use — configure this only if Pexels has explicitly authorized your use case.

### Klein rescue — small scraped images

- **Small-image rescue instruction** → `klein.small_image_prompt`. An optional free-text instruction for **one flow only**: the automatic Klein **rescue** of scraped images under 768 px. Default **empty** — and empty is intentional: with nothing here the app improves from the reference image alone rather than inventing a restoration prompt on your behalf. Unlike the identity prompts above, this field has **no built-in text behind it**, so it stays a plain empty box: there is nothing to pre-fill or reset to. Add an instruction only if you want to steer that rescue (e.g. "sharpen skin texture, keep natural tones"). The manual **"Klein upscale & improve"** action in the lightbox does **not** use this field — it has its own editable prompt under Settings ▸ Engines ▸ **Identity, Klein & Krea 2 prompts** (`identity_prompts.klein_improve`), which can also be turned off for a pure upscale.

## Local tools

Where you point the app at the local programs that unlock the full pipeline: **ComfyUI** (Klein generation and Test Studio), **Ollama** (the vision model behind captioning and framing) and **ai-toolkit** (training and JoyCaption). Each card has a **Test** button that tells you immediately whether the app can see the tool.

### ComfyUI

- **ComfyUI API URL** → `comfyui.api_url`. The HTTP endpoint of your running ComfyUI. Default **`http://127.0.0.1:8188`**. **Test** confirms it answers.
- **ComfyUI install directory** → `comfyui.base_dir`. The folder that contains `models/`, `output/`, `input/`. Default **empty**. This is what lets the app scan your checkpoints and LoRAs — set the API URL alone and there's nothing to scan. If you point it at a `..._windows_portable` folder, the app auto-corrects to the `ComfyUI` sub-folder inside it. In the **Setup wizard** this field is checked as you type: a wrong, empty or missing folder gets a specific reason, and pointing at the launcher/parent folder offers the real ComfyUI inside it in one click. The wizard additionally checks that the app can actually **put a file in that install's `input/` folder** (honouring an `input_dir` override if you set one) — the half it used to certify without testing. A failure there is a **warning, never a blocker**: configuring the app before mounting your volumes is a perfectly normal order of operations.
- **Advanced: ComfyUI folder overrides** → `comfyui.output_dir`, `comfyui.input_dir`, `comfyui.models_dir`, `comfyui.loras_dir`. All default **empty**, and empty is what you want unless ComfyUI runs on folders of its own — a ComfyUI started with `--output-directory`, `--input-directory` or `--models-directory` does *not* keep its files under the install directory, so without an override here the app reads and writes in the wrong place. Each field **shows the folder it falls back to while empty**, computed with the very function the app uses at runtime, so the effective path is never something you have to work out; a path that isn't on disk is flagged in amber rather than failing silently mid-generation. If ComfyUI is running, the app asks it which folders it was launched with (it reports its own command line via `/system_stats`) and offers them in one click — nothing is ever guessed from a folder layout, so no suggestion appears when ComfyUI is unreachable, predates that field, or was started with no custom folders.

  Each field is also checked for **usability, not just existence**: the app *writes* into `input/` (and into the LoRA folder when it installs a trained LoRA), so a folder that is there but cannot be written to from the app's process is flagged in amber with the reason. This is the case that used to be invisible — a ComfyUI in a **separate container, in WSL, or on another machine** answers on its URL while its `input/`/`output/` folders are not shared, so everything looked configured and the first generation died on a detail-free `500` (reported on Discord by nofaceman). The app hands ComfyUI its source images **through the filesystem**, not over the API: `input/` and `output/` must be visible to both sides **at the same path**. See *Troubleshooting → ComfyUI runs in another container*.
- **ComfyUI response timeout** → `comfyui.object_info_timeout_s`. How long ComfyUI may take to answer the one heavy question the app asks it: *list every node class and every model file you have* (`/object_info`). Default **45 s**, clamped to **5-300**. That list grows with every custom-node pack and every weight you install, so this is one of the very few settings whose right value genuinely depends on your install: it was a hardcoded **8 s** until a user measured **~15 s** on his own ComfyUI (j_o_e_l., Discord) and found that Krea 2 generations were being refused with *"ComfyUI isn't running"* — on a ComfyUI that was running. Raise it if you ever see **"ComfyUI is answering too slowly"**; the app now says that instead of blaming a stopped server, and names the number. **A high value costs you nothing when ComfyUI is off**: the connection attempt and the answer have separate budgets, and a ComfyUI that is not listening fails the connection in about 3 seconds no matter what you set here — so background checks never sit waiting for a server that isn't there. If the enumeration does fail, the app remembers that for about 20 seconds instead of letting every screen re-ask for the same multi-megabyte answer; pressing **Refresh models** (or saving Settings) re-asks immediately, which is what you want right after starting ComfyUI.

- **Hugging Face token** → `HF_TOKEN` (secret, no Test button). Only needed to auto-download **license-gated** models — notably the Klein fp8 weights, and the gated training bases (Krea 2, FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.2 Klein). Read access is enough for accepted gated models. This token is handed to the local training subprocess explicitly, so what you save here is what training authenticates with. **If you leave it empty**, a login already on the machine (`hf auth login`, i.e. a token file under `~/.cache/huggingface`, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `$HF_HOME`) is found and used instead — the *Hugging Face cache override* below relocates the cache without logging you out. **When a download is refused, read the status code, not the sentence**: `401` means Hugging Face saw no valid token (paste one here), `403` means the token is valid but that account has not accepted the model licence yet (open the model page and accept it). The raw Hugging Face message says "you must have access to it and be authenticated" in both cases; the failure block in the training panel separates them for you.

**Overrides and `extra_model_paths.yaml`.** These two mechanisms stack rather than compete. `comfyui.models_dir`/`comfyui.loras_dir` set the app's *default* model roots; `extra_model_paths.yaml` is read **in addition**, from `<comfyui.base_dir>/extra_model_paths.yaml` — the same place ComfyUI itself looks. The yaml is therefore always located from the install directory, never from a models override, so the two can't end up pointing at different trees. For models and LoRAs the yaml usually already does the job; the override is for the case where the models folder itself moved.

**Where a deployed LoRA lands.** Reading a LoRA can span every root; installing one has to pick exactly one folder, and the app picks it in this order: the **`comfyui.loras_dir` override** if you filled it (you said where your files go — the yaml cannot take that back), otherwise **the first LoRA root in ComfyUI's own priority order**, otherwise `<install>/models/loras`. In yaml terms that first root is a declared `loras:` folder **only when its profile carries `is_default: true`** — that flag is exactly how ComfyUI is told *look here first*, and a plain extra root stays a secondary location for ComfyUI, so it stays secondary here too. The **open LoRA folder** button opens that same folder, by construction. Reported by Geekswordsman (GitHub #25), whose deploys were landing in `<install>/models/loras` while his yaml declared another folder. LoRAs deployed **before** this changed are still listed, still loadable and still deletable where they are — nothing on disk is moved.

**Continuing without ComfyUI.** Leaving the install directory empty in the Setup wizard is a deliberate choice: it shows what turns off (local Klein generation including the NSFW lane, Klein watermark cleaning, the Test Studio, training on your own ComfyUI base models, and the on-disk LoRA preset picker) versus what stays on (scraping, curation, captioning, the API image engines, ai-toolkit/cloud training, Hugging Face publishing), then remembers the skip (`comfyui.setup_skipped`) so it stops nagging. Entering a directory at any point cancels the skip automatically and turns those features back on — the flag never hides a real problem with a ComfyUI you *have* configured.

**Models outside `models/`?** If your ComfyUI uses an `extra_model_paths.yaml` (portable builds and Stability Matrix installs commonly do), the app reads it the same way ComfyUI does, so bases that live elsewhere are found. This isn't a setting — it follows automatically from your install directory. Without such a file, nothing changes.

This now includes the **training** bases, which were the last exception: an SDXL checkpoint and a Z-Image merge declared in the yaml are listed in the base picker, accepted at launch, and handed to ai-toolkit as a real path. When the same file name exists in two roots, the one a running ComfyUI would load wins (`is_default` first), so you train on the same weights you generate with. Capitalisation of folders and file names doesn't have to match what the picker stored. And when a base genuinely cannot be found, the app says so **naming the file**, instead of passing a bare name down to ai-toolkit and letting it fail on a path you never typed.

### Which local LLM

- **Local LLM provider** → `local_llm.provider`: `ollama` (default) or `lmstudio`. One local model server does captioning, framing auto-classify, auto head-crop, Test Studio Describe & Enhance and the bank's natural-language filter; this picks which. The **Setup wizard asks it too**, on its local-LLM step, whichever provider is currently selected — an install that only has LM Studio should not have to find this page to say so. **Nothing changes for an existing install** — the default is Ollama and the second provider only ever adds a door.

Both cards below stay editable whichever provider is selected, so you can configure the other one and press **Test** before switching. Only the selected provider is checked when the app refreshes its status, so an install pays nothing for a server it does not run.

**A note on the stored value `ollama`.** It is unchanged, everywhere it is written: in `captioning.backend`, in a dataset's saved Captions ⚙️ options, and in the caption-origin column of every image already captioned. Those strings live in databases people already have, and renaming one would silently alter what their saved options mean. What it MEANS has widened: `ollama` now reads as *the configured local provider*.

The labels follow that, so nothing on screen names a server you are not running. Settings ▸ Captioning offers **LM Studio vision** when LM Studio is selected; the per-dataset picker reads **Local LLM only (Ollama / LM Studio)**; the caption-origin badge reads **Local LLM**; and the model pickers, the ✨ Enhance popover and the run window's tooltips all name the provider whose list they are actually showing. Only the stored strings stayed still.

### Ollama

The card shows Ollama's live state and, when the binary is installed but the server isn't running, a **▶ Start Ollama** button that launches it for you — no terminal needed.

- **Ollama URL** → `ollama.url`. Where Ollama is listening. Default **`http://127.0.0.1:11434`**.

**Sharing one Ollama with another tool.** A single local Ollama runs one model
at a time, so if another app has one loaded, LDS refuses to start its own rather
than evict work that isn't its. When that happens, ✨ Enhance and 🔎 Describe say
so and then **wait**: Ollama unloads an idle model by itself after a few minutes,
and your action restarts on its own the moment the model is free — no clicking,
nothing retyped. If you would rather not wait, **Unload it and continue** frees
the other model and resumes; that click is the only thing that ever unloads a
model LDS did not load. Pointing LDS at a *second* Ollama instance on another
port (or another machine) removes the contention entirely. A **remote** URL is
never probed or unloaded — it isn't sharing this machine's GPU.

In Docker, choose the deployment only from **Setup → Ollama**: `none` disables it, `host` uses the existing host service at the authoritative `http://host.docker.internal:11434`, and `docker` uses the isolated companion at the authoritative `http://ollama:11434`. The managed URL is read-only. Neither launcher downloads a model: use the explicit **Pull** button in LDS to see progress and cancel or resume the transfer.

- **Docker deployment mode** → `ollama.deployment_mode`: `none`, `host`, or `docker`. This setting is selected by Setup and applies only to Docker; native installs keep their normal URL-based behavior.
- **Ollama vision model** → `ollama.vision_model`. The vision model used for auto-captioning, framing auto-classify, head-crop and watermark detection. Default **`huihui_ai/qwen3-vl-abliterated:8b-instruct`** — the **abliterated** (uncensored) build, so it captions adult datasets instead of refusing them. **Trap:** keep the **`-instruct`** tag. The plain `:8b` tag is the *Thinking* variant, which reasons out loud instead of captioning and produces garbage here.

- **Images analysed at once** → `ollama.vision_concurrency`. How many images a bank pass sends to Ollama at the same time. Default **4**. The passes that read every image in a bank — watermark scan, framing, captions — spend most of each request waiting on the round-trip rather than on the GPU, so overlapping them roughly **halves** a long pass (measured 2.0× at 4). Going higher gains little: 6 and 8 buy single-digit percentages unless your Ollama is configured for more parallel requests (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL`), and they make **Stop** take a few seconds longer because it waits for the calls already in flight. Set it to **1** to get the old strictly-one-at-a-time behaviour back. Any value the app can't read falls back to 4, and anything above 16 is clamped — a bad value costs you speed, never the pass.

- **Keep the vision model warm** → `ollama.vision_keep_warm_seconds`. How long a *one-off* vision job may leave the model loaded once it's done. Default **120 s** (0 = off, capped at 600). Loading the model costs about **13 s**; describing an image once it's loaded costs about **0.5 s** — so a cold call is roughly **25×** a warm one, and the old behaviour (unload after every single image) made cropping five reference photos in a row pay that load five times. The catch is memory: the vision model really occupies about **7.5 GB**, and a loaded ComfyUI already sits near 19 GB of a 24 GB card, so they don't both fit — on Windows nothing errors out, the driver just pages silently and a vision pass measured **13.5× slower** in that state. Keeping it warm is therefore *conditional and revocable*: the app only leases it when neither a training run nor its own generation queue wants the card, and it hands the memory straight back the moment a generation is submitted or a training starts. If the app can't tell what's using the GPU, it unloads — the old behaviour. Bank passes (watermark / framing / captions) are unaffected: they already keep the model warm for their own duration and unload at the end. Set it to **Off** on a card that's tight on memory, or if you run generations from ComfyUI's own interface (work LDS never sees, so it can't revoke the lease for it — the exposure is bounded by this value). If you *want* ComfyUI and the vision model to genuinely coexist rather than take turns, the lever is on ComfyUI's side, not here: it accepts a `--reserve-vram <GB>` launch flag ("the amount of VRAM in GB to reserve for your OS/other software"), which defaults to a mere 0.7 GB on Windows — that default is exactly why a loaded ComfyUI leaves no room. Raising it caps ComfyUI and frees the headroom, at the cost of heavier video workflows. LDS never launches ComfyUI, so it can't set this for you.

- **Continue without Ollama** → `ollama.setup_skipped`. Ollama is optional and the Setup wizard no longer holds you on its step. If JoyCaption is installed, captioning already works — JoyCaption writes the same captions the vision model would, prose or booru tags depending on what you train — so the step is simply a recommendation. With neither installed, the wizard offers an explicit **Continue without Ollama** that lists what turns off (auto-classify framing, auto head-crop, Test Studio Describe & Enhance, the bank's "Describe filter", the vision route of watermark detection, short captions) versus what stays on, then remembers the choice so it stops asking. Starting Ollama at any point cancels the skip automatically — the flag never hides the state of an Ollama that *is* running, which is why an Ollama that answers but has no model pulled still shows that gap.

**Test** checks end-to-end: that Ollama is reachable *and* the configured model is actually pulled.

### LM Studio

LM Studio is a local model server with its own desktop app. Two differences from Ollama shape everything here:

- **Its server can be started from here — if LM Studio has been opened once.** LM Studio installs a small command-line tool the first time it runs, and LDS uses it: when that tool is found, a stopped server shows **▶ Start LM Studio** in Settings ▸ Local tools and on the Setup step. A model you had loaded **stays loaded** when only the server was stopped (measured, not assumed); if LM Studio itself was closed, the server comes back with **nothing loaded** and you load a model in its Developer tab. Either way the server is started on the port Settings names rather than whichever one it last used. When the tool is not found the card says where the switch is instead (LM Studio ▸ **Developer** ▸ **Start Server**) — a button that could not work would be worse than a sentence.
- **It only serves a model that is already loaded — so LDS loads it.** JIT loading is off by default, and a freshly installed LM Studio answers every list request while refusing every generation. LDS therefore loads the model itself: automatically the first time captioning, framing or a prompt helper needs it, or from the **⏬ Load the vision model** button (Setup and Settings ▸ Local tools). It loads the configured model, else the downloaded vision model; a model LDS loaded is one LDS may also unload later to hand the GPU to ComfyUI, while a model **you** loaded is never touched. Only **downloading** models stays in LM Studio (it shows progress and lets you cancel). Readiness still reports *a model is loaded*, never *the server answered*.

- **LM Studio URL** → `lmstudio.url`. The server root. Default **`http://127.0.0.1:1234`**. LM Studio's own Developer tab advertises it as `http://localhost:1234/v1`; **either form is accepted** — the `/v1` is stripped before use, because left in place it would both build wrong request paths and make the GPU arbitration refuse every call.
- **LM Studio model** → `lmstudio.vision_model`. Leave it **empty** and LDS uses whichever model LM Studio has loaded, which is usually what you want. Name one and LDS insists on that exact model being loaded.
- **Images analysed at once** → `lmstudio.vision_concurrency`. Same meaning as the Ollama dial, kept separate because the two servers do not take the same load: LM Studio serves as many parallel requests as its own **Parallel** setting allows, and going wider here than that gains nothing.
- **Keep the vision model warm** → `lmstudio.vision_keep_warm_seconds`. Honoured differently, and worth knowing: Ollama takes a per-request keep-alive, LM Studio has no TTL at all and holds a loaded model until something unloads it. So under LM Studio this value is how long LDS waits before actively unloading — and unlike Ollama, that unload genuinely frees the VRAM.
- **LM Studio API key (optional)** → the `LMSTUDIO_API_KEY` secret, set from the card itself, and only needed if you turned on authentication in LM Studio. It is a **secret**, not a config field: like every other credential here it lives in the app's secret store rather than in `config.json`, so it never comes back out of `GET /api/settings` and never appears in a pasted diagnostic. Empty by default, and most local setups never need it.

**Test** checks end to end: reachable *and* a usable model is loaded.

### ai-toolkit

- **ai-toolkit directory** → `aitoolkit.dir`. The folder containing ai-toolkit's `run.py`. Default **empty**. **Test** validates it and unlocks training + JoyCaption captioning. **Test also runs `import torch` on the chosen interpreter** — a folder that looks right but is paired with a Python that has no training dependencies used to pass this check and then fail every run.
- ⚠ **This is ai-toolkit's folder and ai-toolkit's Python, not the Studio's.** The app you are using has its own `.venv`; the ai-toolkit folder has its own venv, the one carrying `torch`. The Next.js UI shipped inside ai-toolkit (`ui/`, port 8675) is unrelated — this app never launches or reads it. See [What is running on your machine](getting-started.md#architecture).
- **Python interpreter (optional)** → `aitoolkit.python`. Default **empty = auto-detect** a `venv/` or `.venv/` next to `run.py`. Fill this with the full path to the interpreter ai-toolkit should run with whenever there is no venv folder for the app to find — **conda, uv, the system Python**, or a **portable / embedded build** that ships its own `python_embeded\python.exe` (several community install scripts do exactly that). Examples: `C:\miniconda3\envs\aitk\python.exe`, `C:\ai-toolkit\python_embeded\python.exe`. A venv is one way to give ai-toolkit a Python, not a requirement — when Setup finds a plausible interpreter inside the ai-toolkit folder, it offers to fill this in for you in one click. **Nothing ever fills this field on your behalf**: it is set by that one-click offer, or typed here. **A value here always wins over auto-detection**, so a wrong path silently shadows a perfectly good venv — which is why a training launch now refuses, naming the path, when the interpreter set here cannot `import torch`, and offers the working venv it found next to `run.py` instead (reported by strouder, GitHub #19). On Windows, watch out for `…\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe`: that is usually the Store alias, not a real Python. See also the [supported Python versions](getting-started.md#python-versions) — ai-toolkit wants 3.11.

Under **Advanced: ai-toolkit overrides**, three optional path overrides (all default empty → derived from the ai-toolkit directory):

- **Datasets directory override** → `aitoolkit.datasets_dir` (defaults to `<dir>/datasets`).
- **Output directory override** → `aitoolkit.output_dir` (defaults to `<dir>/output`).
- **Hugging Face cache override** → `aitoolkit.hf_home` (defaults to a cache under the ai-toolkit folder). Point this at an existing HF cache to avoid re-downloading base models. It moves the *cache* only: a `hf auth login` token stored in your default Hugging Face home stays in use, so relocating the cache never de-authenticates you on gated bases.

## Captioning & quality

Settings for how captions are produced and how the quality tools behave.

### Dataset import

What happens to a photo the **moment it enters a dataset**. The default now
keeps the source as the master file; a training launch creates its own disposable
working copies. This follows **Qeeyana (Reddit)** asking: *"Images added to
'dataset' are automatically normalized to 1024. Why? Let me choose not to."*

- **Stored encoding** → `dataset_import.encoding`. Default **`preserve`**.
  | Value | What is written |
  |---|---|
  | `preserve` *(default)* | An un-cropped JPG/JPEG, PNG, WebP or BMP is kept byte-for-byte with the matching extension. `max_side` is ignored. |
  | `standard` | Opt-in normalization to WebP quality 92, with the selected maximum side. |
  | `high` | Opt-in normalization to WebP quality 100, with the selected maximum side. Still lossy. |
  | `lossless` | Opt-in normalization to lossless WebP, with the selected maximum side. |
  `preserve` is for a dataset that is also your archive. It does not ask the
  trainer to consume an arbitrary source file: at training start LDS writes
  temporary PNG + caption pairs for ai-toolkit, then leaves the imported master
  untouched.

**Import safety limit — every mode:** Before preserve, WebP normalization, or
auto head-crop can decode the source, it must fit the **Image size budget**
below (shipped default **64 Mi-pixels** and **16384 px per side**). A larger
file is rejected, and the message names the setting. WebP normalization does
not bypass this admission limit.
- **Stored resolution** → `dataset_import.max_side`. Used only by the three WebP
normalization modes. Choose `1024`, `1536`, `2048`, `4096`, or `0` = original
size. The aspect ratio is always preserved (no square padding) and an image is
never enlarged. This output setting takes effect only after the source passes
the import safety limit above; normalized output also clamps the longest side to
**8192 px** — that ceiling bounds what is *written* by a WebP mode and is
deliberately independent of the input budget.

### Image size budget

How large a source image **any** part of the app may decode. Not an import-only
rule: dataset import, ZIP and scrape ingest, Bank scan and thumbnails, edits,
ComfyUI staging and Ollama vision captioning all read these two keys, so an
image you can import is an image you can look at.

- **Maximum total pixels** → `image_input.max_pixels`. Default
  **`67108864`** (64 Mi-pixels). `0` = no limit.
- **Maximum side** → `image_input.max_side`. Default **`16384`** px. `0` = no
  limit.

This is a **memory** budget, not an encoder limit: a decoded RGB pixel costs 3
bytes (RGBA 4), and an edit or analysis pass can hold a second copy at the same
time. So 64 Mi-pixels is about **192 MiB** for one decoded RGB buffer and
roughly **384 MiB** while a working copy exists. It admits every current phone
and 35 mm camera master (a 61 MP 9504×6336 frame is 57 Mi-pixels) and ordinary
stitched panoramas — the previous fixed 16 Mi-pixels / 8192 px refused both.

**What `0` disarms.** No limit means a corrupt or hostile file can be decoded
until it fills memory: a few hundred header bytes can claim billions of pixels,
and the app has no second guard behind this one — an unlimited budget also lifts
Pillow's own decompression-bomb threshold, so the choice is real in both
directions. It is offered because "let it through" is a legitimate answer for a
panorama you produced yourself.

**Inference workers get it handed down, one lane at a time.** Face, aesthetic and
NSFW scoring, semantic indexing and watermark inpainting run in a separate Python
interpreter that cannot import the app or its config, so their shared guard
(`backend/infer/bank_image_guard.py`) enforces its own fixed 16 Mi-pixel /
8192 px ceiling unless the lane that launched it passes this budget down as
environment.

**JoyCaption captioning does.** It was the lane where the split actually hurt: an
image this budget accepts imports, displays and trains normally, but the
captioner refused it one by one — a 89-image dataset of camera masters came back
with 37 captions and 52 refusals reading *"bank image rejects images above 8192 px
per side or 16777216 pixels"*. Captioning now enforces the budget above (the
model sees a 384 px copy either way), and a pass that still has to refuse an image
counts it and repeats the engine's own reason in its result line instead of just
returning a smaller number.

**The other lanes still keep the fixed ceiling.** Scoring, embedding and watermark
work hold a model and a full decode at once, and nobody has measured what a 64
Mi-pixel input costs them — so they keep the conservative number rather than
inherit an unmeasured one. An image above it imports, displays and trains
normally; those workers skip it.

**Auto head-crop is deliberately different.** It changes the picture into a
square head shot, so it creates a derived WebP even when `preserve` is selected.
The same is true of later edits such as crop, rotate and watermark clean: a
transformed image is not the original master any more.

**Changing this is not retroactive.** It applies to images imported *from now
on*, so a dataset can hold mixed formats and sizes. That is harmless for training
(every trainer buckets and downscales on its own). Existing WebPs cannot be
reconstructed into the source files that were discarded by older versions.

**What it does NOT touch**: generated images, the ≤2048 px copies handed to an
image API, and any image you have already curated — those lanes keep their own
fixed sizes on purpose.

### Captioning

- **Captioning backend** → `captioning.backend`. Which captioner writes your captions. Default **`auto`**.

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `auto` *(default)* | Prefer JoyCaption (via ai-toolkit), fall back to the Ollama vision model. |
| `joycaption` | JoyCaption only. |
| `ollama` | Ollama vision model only. |
| `none` | No auto-captioning — you write them yourself. |

`auto` is a **chain**, not a coin toss: JoyCaption captions the images it can in one
batch, the Ollama vision model covers whatever is left, and on a **Concept** dataset
Ollama rewrites JoyCaption's drafts. The two engines write in different styles, so one
batch can come back in two voices. Every caption pass now reports which engine wrote
what — in the toast, and on a line under the caption buttons (Captions ▸ Generate
captions), e.g. *“8 by JoyCaption · 4 by Ollama”*. That line describes the last pass
of the current session only; nothing is stored per image. Pick a single value above
(or per dataset, in Captions ▸ ⚙️ Options) if you want one voice across a set.

### Watermark inpainting

- **Processing device** → `watermark.device`. Where LaMa inpainting runs. Default **`auto`**. Options: `auto` (GPU when available, otherwise CPU), `cuda` (force GPU — pauses ComfyUI while cleaning), `cpu` (keep the GPU free). This only affects the **LaMa** engine.
- **Allow automatic crop** → `watermark.allow_crop`. Default **on**. When on, a watermark sitting in an outer border band is **cropped off** (a pure pixel crop — it invents nothing). Turn it **off** and such a mark is **repainted instead** (with LaMa or Klein per the chosen engine) rather than cropped. The exact same preference is editable inline in the workspace's **Clean** bar — it's one shared value, so changing it in either place changes both.

**Honest note on engine choice.** The **LaMa (fast) vs Klein (quality)** engine is *not* a Settings toggle — it's a per-batch picker in the Clean bar and a per-image choice in the review lightbox. `watermark.device` above governs LaMa only; Klein cleaning runs through ComfyUI.

### Face similarity

Two thresholds on the 0–1 face-similarity score (InsightFace), which badge each image against your reference.

- **Face score — green threshold** → `face_scoring.green`. At or above this, the image is a **strong match** (green). Default **`0.50`**.
- **Face score — orange threshold** → `face_scoring.orange`. At or above this but below green, it's **borderline** (orange); below it, red. Default **`0.45`**.

Raise them for a stricter set, lower them if good shots are being flagged too harshly.

**These thresholds do nothing on an Anime dataset.** InsightFace is trained on
photographs and cannot read a drawn face, so face similarity is refused outright
when the dataset's **subject type** is *Anime* — the 🎭 Analyze faces button, 🎯
Auto-triage, Best epoch and the Test Studio's face scoring all say so instead of
producing numbers nobody could measure. There is no override, on purpose: the
subject type *is* the switch. If the dataset really is photographic, set it back to
*Human* and everything scores again — scores from an earlier pass are never
deleted. Head-cropping a reference is unaffected: it runs on the vision model
(Qwen3-VL), which reads a drawn head fine.

### Image bank triage

Thresholds for the **🗃️ Bank** quality flags. Every scanned image stores its
**raw scores**, and the flags are recomputed against these values on every
read — so changing a threshold re-sorts an already-scanned bank instantly,
with **no rescan**. (The two exceptions are noted below.)

> **The same twelve values are editable from the Bank itself** — open
> **🎚 Filter thresholds** above the grid, under the filter chips they decide.
> It is one setting seen in two places, not a copy: editing either one writes
> `config.bank.<key>` and therefore applies to **every** bank. The Bank panel
> additionally previews how many images a candidate value would flag before you
> save, and groups the controls by intent. See
> *Using the app → Tune the Bank filter thresholds*.

- **Sharpness minimum** → `bank.sharpness_min`. The 90th percentile of per-region Laplacian variance under this = flagged **🌫 blurry**. Default **`150`**. Raise it to be stricter about focus, lower it if artistic soft shots get flagged. The regional score keeps a sharp subject from being condemned by a deliberately soft background. The former `100` default belonged to the old whole-frame scale and could not flag even the lowest-scoring image in a measured 36,921-image bank; an unchanged saved `100` is migrated to `150`, while any other hand-tuned value is preserved. A bank scanned before the regional change carries lower whole-frame scores: re-run the Quality pass to compare like with like.
- **Noise maximum** → `bank.noise_max`. High-frequency residual (RMS vs a Gaussian blur) over this = flagged **📺 noisy**. Default **`15`**. Heavily textured images (foliage, fabric) score high by nature — this is a flag to review, not a verdict.
- **Uniformity minimum** → `bank.uniformity_min`. Grayscale spread under this = flagged **⬜ flat** (solid colors, black frames, empty screenshots). Default **`12`**.
- **Minimum side (px)** → `bank.min_side`. Smaller image side under this = flagged **📐 small**. Default **`768`** — the same bar as the dataset import guard, because trainers only ever *downscale*.
- **Real-detail minimum** → `bank.detail_min`. Share of the stored size (0–1) that still carries real picture, under which an image is flagged **🫧 soft detail**. Default **`0.72`** — on a real 36 000-image bank that selects the softest ~3%, and it sits below the 10th percentile of images measured to be genuinely full-resolution, so a sharp photo does not trip it. **What it measures:** the scan shrinks the image and rebuilds it at a ladder of sizes; the smallest size that still reconstructs it is where the picture actually stops. An image enlarged from 512 to 2048 rebuilds perfectly from a quarter-size copy, so it reads ~0.5 and the bank says *"2048 px stored · ~512 px of real detail"*. **What it does NOT measure:** which of the possible causes it was. Motion blur, an out-of-focus background and aggressive denoising remove the same detail and read the same way — treat it exactly like the sharpness score, as a shortlist to look at, never as proof an image was enlarged. It also cannot see nearest-neighbour enlargement (blocky pixels are real detail) and it under-states large enlargements, so the pixel figure is a rank, not a measurement of the original file.
- **Black-bar maximum** → `bank.bars_max`. Share of the frame (0–1) that may be flat black letterbox/pillarbox before an image is flagged **🎞 black bars**. Default **`0.04`**; it caught ~4% of the reference bank (screenshots of videos, stills padded into a square). Those bars survive a training crop, so they are worth seeing.
- **Duplicate distance** → `bank.dup_distance`. How many of the 64 perceptual-hash bits two images may differ by and still be grouped as **≈ near-duplicates**. Default **`8`** (the same hash and distance the dataset import dedup uses). *Applies at the next quality scan* (groups are rebuilt then).
- **Same-person similarity** → `bank.face_threshold`. Cosine similarity at or above which two faces cluster as the same person in **👥 Group by person**. Default **`0.45`**. Raise it if different people get merged into one cluster; lower it if the same person splits into several. *Applies at the next face pass* (embeddings are cached, so re-clustering is fast).
- **Aesthetic minimum** → `bank.aesthetic_min`. LAION aesthetic score (~1–10) under which an image is flagged **💔 low aesthetic** — the "keep the nice ones" cut. Default **`5`**. Only images the **✨ Score** pass reached carry a score; an unscored image is never flagged. The score also drives "keep best" on duplicate groups (the nicest-looking copy wins).
- **NSFW maximum** → `bank.nsfw_max`. NSFW probability (0–1) over which an image is flagged **🔞 NSFW**, to split a mixed SFW/NSFW dump. Default **`0.5`**. Set by the **✨ Score** pass; a review flag, not a verdict.
- **Same-style similarity** → `bank.style_threshold`. Cosine similarity on the CLIP image embeddings at or above which two images share a visual **🎨 style** (screenshots/memes cluster apart from photoreal) in the **✨ Score** pass. Default **`0.6`**. *Applies at the next scoring pass* — the embeddings are cached, so re-clustering at another threshold costs **no inference at all**: the pass does not even load the model. It is not instant, though, and the cost is the grouping itself, which compares every image with every other: **~8 s over 5 000 images, ~3 min over 23 000** (measured). Stopping the pass during that phase leaves the previous grouping in place rather than writing half of a new one — the ids are one numbering of the whole bank, so half of them would collide with the other half. **A measured limit, on a big single-subject bank:** the grouping is *transitive* (A groups with B and B with C puts A with C, even if A and C look nothing alike), so on a bank whose images are all of one person a chain of near-neighbours can merge everything into one group. Measured on a 25 058-image bank at the default `0.6`: **one group holding 25 056 of them** — and raising the threshold does not open a middle ground so much as move the cliff (0.8 → one group of 24 735; 0.9 → one of 15 066; 0.95 → the grouping shatters into 19 716 groups, 17 137 of them single images). The end-of-pass line now states the size of the biggest group against the total, so this is visible without opening the database. If your bank is varied, the default behaves; if it is one subject shot over and over, expect the 🎨 style chip to be close to useless whatever the threshold, and use ✂ **Find crops & variants** (a much tighter, per-pair comparison) for the grouping you probably wanted.
- **Semantic duplicate similarity** → `bank.semantic_dup_threshold`. CLIP cosine similarity at or above which two images are grouped as a **✂ semantic near-duplicate** — a crop or re-compressed variant of the *same shot* that the perceptual-hash **≈ Duplicates** (stage 1) misses. Default **`0.96`**. With CLIP selected it needs **✨ Score** first. SigLIP 2 uses the separate conservative starting value `bank_semantic.siglip2_semantic_dup_threshold`; it deliberately does not inherit the CLIP cutoff, and should be reviewed/calibrated on your Banks. Re-running the grouping reuses the selected cache; no image inference. **Re-running it over an untouched Bank does not even do that**: the pass compares a signature of everything it reads — the embedding cache, the rows, their style blocks, the threshold — and answers *already up to date — N group(s), nothing changed* in a second. The launch window also shows when it last ran and what it found. **The limit of that shortcut, stated plainly:** the signature is made of state, not pixels, so an image *replaced on disk at the same path* while its cached embedding stayed behind is the one change it cannot see. That cache is stale by then and the full pass is what detects it — POST `force: true` on `/api/bank/<id>/semantic-dedup` to skip the shortcut and redo the work.

The **Score** pass (aesthetic · NSFW · style) needs the **Bank scoring** extra (Setup ▸ Quality tools); **Find watermarks** reuses the vision model from **Captioning**. Both are GPU passes, serialized against training and captioning, and detection-only — the bank never edits your source files.
- **Which Python runs ✨ Score** → `bank_scoring.python`. **Auto-managed:** leave it empty and Setup ▸ Quality tools builds a dedicated environment and fills it in. It carries **CPU-only PyTorch** on purpose (a first install stays small instead of pulling ~2.5 GB of CUDA wheels on machines with no card), which costs roughly **336 ms per image** instead of ~15 ms on a GPU. On a machine that already has a working CUDA PyTorch — ai-toolkit's venv, ComfyUI's, a conda env — you can point Score at it instead: open a bank and click **⚡ Use a GPU Python I already have** under the CPU warning. The picker checks each candidate *package by package* (`torch`, `open_clip`, `transformers`, `timm`, `numpy`, `Pillow`) and **refuses** any interpreter that can't run the whole pass — CUDA alone is not enough, and a missing `open_clip` would only surface an hour into a run. Nothing is ever installed into an environment the app did not build: a missing package is named with the exact command, for you to run. A GPU interpreter is **not purely a speed setting**: a Score pass that really runs on the card takes it exclusively — ComfyUI is unloaded, a training run cannot start, and other GPU passes and queued banks answer *“GPU busy”* until it finishes. On the CPU-only default Score holds nothing. A borrowed interpreter that wedges (ComfyUI's own can stall on CUDA start-up while ComfyUI still holds the card) is stopped after **15 minutes of no output** so the GPU is released rather than left refusing everything. Reversible at any time (**Back to the app default**), and leaving it alone changes nothing — detection is an offer, never a prerequisite. The picker also accepts a path you type: an interpreter **or** the environment folder holding it (venv, conda/miniconda, uv, a portable bundle, the system Python, another disk), spaces and accents included. No torch or CUDA *version* is required — only that the modules import and `torch.cuda.is_available()` is true. On a machine with no NVIDIA card the picker says so and stops suggesting CUDA; it still lets you borrow an interpreter that already has the packages, to avoid installing them twice. The **Install / ↻ Reinstall** button in Setup ▸ Quality tools honours the same rule: while Score is pointed at a borrowed interpreter it installs nothing and prints the `pip install` command instead — clear the setting (**Back to the app default**) if you want the app to build and fill its own environment again. See *Using the app ▸ Make Score use a GPU Python you already have*.

**Not a setting, but it lives with them:** the **🎨 Pick diverse** popover in a
bank carries a **Skip the odd ones out** slider (0–100%, **default 50%**) next to
its *How many*. It is a per-click control — chosen where you use it, not stored
in `config.json` — because it is a property of the selection you are asking for,
not of the bank. "Most diverse" is farthest-point sampling, which by construction
favours the most *isolated* images; the slider discounts an image for being alone
in the bank so memes, screenshots and stray photos of someone else stop winning
the first picks, while anything as typical as the median of the bank is left
untouched (it cannot pull the selection towards look-alikes). **0 reproduces the
pure-coverage behaviour this button had before the slider existed** — the change
of default does change what a given bank returns. See *Using the app ▸ Curate down
to the right subset*.

- **Watermark detection** → `watermark_detect.backend`. Which engine **🧽 Find watermarks** uses, on datasets *and* banks. `auto` (default) takes the optional watermark-detector extra when it is installed — ~0.14 s per image and it returns a score — and the Ollama vision model otherwise; that is the behaviour that shipped, so leaving this alone changes nothing. `detector` and `vision` pin one engine. A pinned `detector` with the extra **not** installed does not fail the scan: the vision model runs it and the app says so, naming *Setup ▸ Quality tools ▸ Watermark detector*. The two engines disagree at the margins, and only the detector can flag an image *without* a position — those are counted apart and 🧽 Clean leaves them for 🔍 Review instead of marking them failed. *Applies at the next scan; images already dismissed as false positives are only re-judged by **⟲ Rescan incl. dismissed**.*
- **Watermark detector sensitivity** → `watermark_detect.threshold`. The score (0–1) at or above which **🚩 Find watermarks** flags an image, *when the optional watermark-detector extra is installed* (Setup ▸ Quality tools). Default **`0.94`**. Also editable **inside the 🚩 launch window itself**, on the bank and the dataset alike — the slider writes this same stored value through, so it is tuned where its effect is judged and the two surfaces cannot drift apart. On the vision route there is no score to compare against, so the window says so rather than showing a slider that does nothing. *Applies at the next scan.*
  This number is **measured, not chosen**, and it is deliberately nowhere near the 0.5 a probability normally implies: the classifier's scores sit hard against 1. On a 110-image sample drawn from a real 29 759-image bank and labelled by eye (2026-08-03, CPU), a threshold of 0.5 would have flagged **52 of the 55 clean images**; 0.94 flagged **none** of them and still caught **54 of the 55** marked ones. The clean images topped out at 0.939 and the marked ones bottomed out at 0.929, so the two populations overlap by about 0.01 — there is no setting that is perfect, only a knee. Lower it towards 0.92 to catch the faintest marks and hand-check a few clean images; raise it towards 0.96 to miss a mark rather than crop anything by mistake.
- **Watermark detector interpreter** → `watermark_detect.python`. Written by the installer, and now also pickable from the Bank's **🚩 Watermarks** panel (**⚡ Use a GPU Python I already have** — same dialog family as ✨ Score and SigLIP 2, see the Guide). The installer pins its own CPU-torch environment here, so on a machine with a card the scan stays on the CPU until you point this at a CUDA Python (ComfyUI's, ai-toolkit's). Empty means "use the **Bank scoring** interpreter, then the app's own".
- **Watermark detector weights** → `watermark_detect.models_root`. Empty means `data/models/watermark_detect` (~0.9 GB, downloaded once at install).
- **Watermark detector device** → `watermark_detect.device` (`auto` | `cuda` | `cpu`). The extra installs CPU-only torch, so this is CPU unless you point `watermark_detect.python` at an environment with a CUDA torch. The pass only takes the exclusive-GPU window (which unloads ComfyUI and blocks a training start) when it will actually use the card.
- **Locate the mark** → `watermark_detect.locate` (default on). Runs the second model on the images the first one flagged, to record **where** the mark sits. Off means images are flagged with no position, and neither **✂ Auto-crop** nor **🧽 Inpaint** can route on them — only worth turning off on a bank you intend to filter rather than clean.

The **✨ Score** pass (aesthetic · NSFW · style) needs the **Bank scoring** extra (Setup ▸ Quality tools). **🚩 Find watermarks** runs one of two ways: the **watermark detector** extra when it is installed (~0.14 s per image, and it does not need Ollama at all), otherwise the vision model from **Captioning** (~1.7 s per image). Installing the extra only ever adds the faster route — with nothing installed the pass behaves exactly as it always has. Both are detection-only: the bank never edits your source files.

## Training

Defaults for new local training runs.

### Defaults

- **Default training family** → `training.default_family`. The model family preselected when you start a new run. One of `zimage`, `sdxl`, `krea`, `flux`, `flux2klein`, `anima`. Default **`zimage`**. Purely a starting point — you can switch family per run. `anima` trains the open [Anima](https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima-Base-v1.0-Diffusers) anime model on its public base (no gated download); it is **local-only** for now (needs an up-to-date ai-toolkit + diffusers — cloud training arrives once the GPU pod image is verified). **Anima is the one family with hybrid prompting:** booru tags *and* natural language are both first-class on it, so the caption-style guard says nothing there — prose is merely the preselected default, and a booru-captioned Anima dataset trains without being flagged or forced. Every other family keeps its single expected form (SDXL = booru tags, the rest = prose).

This fork's Settings → Training keeps **Defaults** and **Train on another machine** — there is no rental-GPU card here (no key field, no cost/budget knobs). Cloud training (vast.ai) still runs underneath for any dataset that already has a cloud run in its history — see **Cloud training (vast.ai)** under [Config-file-only settings](#config-file-only-settings) for the `VAST_API_KEY` secret and the `cloud.*` guard-rails, all of which are edited by hand in `config.json`/`.env` rather than through a Settings card.

### Train on another machine

Two fields, both blank by default. Blank means the feature is off and every run trains here, exactly as before.

- **ai-toolkit web address** → `aitoolkit.url`. The address of a *running* ai-toolkit web UI, typically `http://localhost:8675`. Distinct from `aitoolkit.dir` under [Local tools](#local-tools): `dir` is the checkout this app shells `run.py` in, this is a UI a job can be **submitted** to so it can choose the GPU. Set it and a **Train on** picker appears next to *Train the LoRA* in a dataset's Training panel.
- **Its access token** → `aitoolkit.token`. Only needed if that ai-toolkit runs with `AI_TOOLKIT_AUTH` set. Blank otherwise.

**Point it at this machine's own ai-toolkit.** This app exports the dataset to a folder on this disk and hands that path over, so an address on another box would name a folder it cannot see. The machines you can then send a run to are the ones *that* ai-toolkit has configured — it stages the dataset onward, starts the job, and mirrors the log, samples and checkpoints back. This app never talks to the far machine itself.

Known limits, all deliberate:

| Limit | Why |
|---|---|
| The picker never offers **this machine's** GPUs, only other machines' | A run in this lane does not set the machine-wide GPU-busy flag, so image generation and the bank's GPU passes would start on top of it. *Train the LoRA* with **This machine** selected is the local path, unchanged |
| A run sent elsewhere always starts **fresh** | Previous checkpoints are not sent over, so there is no Resume/Fresh question to ask |
| One run per dataset at a time | Two runs would write the same run folder and the same log |
| An offline machine is listed and **disabled**, not hidden | Hiding it reads exactly like never having configured it |
| A failed run stays on screen for an hour, then ages out | Long enough to be read, short enough not to nag |

The readiness guards are the same either way — captions that do not match the
family, uncaptioned images, the image floor — and so are the "train anyway"
confirms. A dataset does not become well-formed by being trained elsewhere.

Base models are **not** copied. The machine that trains downloads its own weights with its own Hugging Face token — only the dataset and the job config cross the network.

### Training base & variant are per FAMILY

The **Base** and **variant** chosen in *Advanced training options* belong to the
model family they were chosen under, not to the dataset as a whole. Switching
**LoRA type** hands you that family's own base — the official one the first time
you pick it — and switching back restores what you had. Nothing is discarded:
each family's choice is remembered on the dataset.

This matters because the choices are not interchangeable. A Z-Image base is a
ComfyUI merge **name** that gets converted to the diffusers layout first; Krea 2,
FLUX.1 and FLUX.2 Klein take an **absolute path** to a `.safetensors` of their own
architecture. Before this, one dataset held one base for every family, so a base
picked for Z-Image stayed attached to a Krea 2 run — where it was silently ignored
in favour of the official base, while the panel's summary line and the cloud
dialog both went on advertising it.

A base that provably belongs to another family (found on datasets created before
this change) is reported as such in the panel and is not used.

### Krea 2: the checkpoints on your disk are listed as bases

The **Base** dropdown under *LoRA type = Krea 2* offers the official base **and**
every Krea 2 checkpoint found in your ComfyUI `unet` / `diffusion_models` folders,
including the roots declared in `extra_model_paths.yaml` — the same scan the Test
Studio uses. That is how a full model one of your own runs delivered, or a
community Krea 2 build, becomes something you can keep training on.

The value stored is the **absolute path** of the file, not the ComfyUI folder name
the Studio uses, because the trainer identifies a custom base by its being an
absolute path and a cloud pod has to receive the actual file. A checkpoint the app
can list but cannot resolve to a file on disk is left out of the dropdown rather
than offered as a name a run would ignore.

Each entry says what its format costs before you pick it:

- **no tag** — full precision, nothing to report;
- **`· fp8 cast`** — the weights are stored in fp8 under the tensor names a
  full-precision file already had, with nothing extra. The trainer up-casts it as
  it loads, and selecting it shows how many of the file's tensors are quantized
  and how many significand bits that leaves. The lost precision does not come
  back. The tag reads the *packing*, not the architecture: a file can be tagged
  this way and still be refused at load for carrying a tensor the model family
  does not declare;
- **`· packed export`** — a ComfyUI scaled-fp8 / `comfy_quant` / int8 repack. It
  carries decompression tables as extra tensors that a trainer's strict load
  rejects, so the load fails outright. Selecting it is refused, and training is
  blocked until another base is picked. Use the bf16/fp16 master instead — a
  full-model run keeps it next to its fp8 twin and the Checkpoints panel lists it.

With no ComfyUI folder configured the list falls back to the official base alone,
and says so.

### Concept face masking

Used **only** by Concept datasets that switched **Mask faces** on in *Advanced
training options* (see the dataset guide, §8). It re-weights the training loss over
detected faces so the concept learns the act rather than the identities in your
photos — it never alters your images. Both knobs are exposed rather than frozen
because no published measurement exists for the right value; preview the effect on
your own images from the training panel.

- **Head coverage (face box ×)** → `face_mask.expand`. Face detection returns a box
  running from the eyes to the chin; this grows it around its centre (biased upward,
  to catch hair) into a head. Default **2.0**, clamped to **1.0–3.0**. Higher covers
  hair and jaw, lower stays tight on the face. 2.0 matches the only published default
  for this detector/mask combination.
- **Loss weight kept on faces** → `face_mask.min_weight`. How much the masked area
  still counts, from 0 (nothing) to 1 (unmasked). Default **0.1**, clamped to
  **0.05–1.0**. Lower pushes identity out harder. **It deliberately cannot reach
  zero**: an area worth nothing isn't ignored, it's *unpenalised* — the model may
  render anything there at no cost, degraded anatomy is reported right below this
  floor, and a fully masked close-up would divide by zero in the trainer's own mask
  normalisation and kill the run.

Changing these does **not** affect the person-masking used by Character datasets;
that keeps its own historical weight.

**It needs face detection installed, and that is optional.** The detector is
InsightFace, the same optional extra face-similarity scoring uses — it is filed
under the `face_scoring` key (hence `face_scoring.python` and
`face_scoring.models_root` in *Settings ▸ Local tools*), but nothing installs it
for you. When it is missing, the **Mask faces** option says so and offers a
one-click install right there (~400 MB, a few minutes); the rest of the app is
unaffected and works exactly as before. If you launch a run with **Mask faces**
still on and the detector absent, the pre-launch report warns that the run would
train *unmasked* and asks you to confirm — it never blocks, and never trains
unmasked without telling you first. On a Python outside **3.10–3.12** InsightFace
publishes no wheels: the option explains that instead of offering an install that
could only fail, and points at `face_scoring.python` so you can aim it at a
separate 3.10–3.12 interpreter.

### Advanced options (per run)

#### Preview quality — steps and CFG

Adopted from upstream 2026-08-24 (GitHub #46). It is a property of the BASE,
not of a lane: a distilled checkpoint previews in 8 steps at CFG 1, a
non-distilled one needs 20–35 at CFG 4–6, and a run on a base the studio does
not ship gets whichever of those two guesses is wrong. Both boxes live beside
the preview prompts in a dataset's ⚙️ Advanced options.

| Setting | Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Preview quality (steps / CFG)** | `sample_steps` / `sample_guidance` | per base | Empty follows the base: 8 steps at CFG 1 on a distilled one, 20–35 at CFG 4–6 otherwise — the boxes show that default as their placeholder. Set them when you train on a base the studio does not ship and the previews come back as sketches (raise the steps) or cost more time than the training they interrupt (lower them). Preview rendering only, never the weights, which is why **▶ Continue** may change them even on a full-state resume. See *Preview quality — steps and CFG* in the dataset guide. |

These live under **⚙️ Advanced options** in a dataset's training panel — rank, resolution, save/sample cadence, optimizer, scheduler, EMA, LoKr and more. Each carries its own inline **Why/How** note, so they aren't repeated here. Two are worth calling out because of a caveat.

#### Krea 2 Raw · LoKr likeness — a reported community starting point

The built-in **Krea 2 Raw · LoKr likeness** preset is deliberately narrow: it is
shown only for a **Character** dataset on a compatible Krea 2 Base/Raw variant.
It turns a [reported Krea 2 Raw LoKr recipe from the Stable Diffusion
community](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1v2vsqm/almost_perfect_likeness_in_750_steps_krea_2_lokr/)
into a named, inspectable starting point — **not** into a promise that a different
person, image set, captioning style or checkpoint will match at the same step.

The post linked a full Pastebin configuration, but that Pastebin has since been
deleted. LDS therefore records only the values the post actually reports:
**LoKr factor 16**, **768 px**, **Automagic2** with initial learning rate
**`1e-4`**, **Sigmoid** timestep weighting, **Balanced** content/style mode,
**Differential Guidance** at scale **3**, and a checkpoint/preview cadence of
**250** steps. The Krea-only Expert controls show those values plainly, and the
run snapshot carries the factor, content/style mode and Differential Guidance so
you can compare an experiment later instead of trusting a remembered recipe.

The post does **not** publish the LoKr linear rank or alpha. LDS keeps its
existing Krea Character **32/32** choice rather than inventing a rank/alpha pair
and presenting it as sourced. Likewise, the reported **3000 total steps** are
not forced by the preset: LDS keeps its adaptive step policy so a small dataset
is not silently overcooked. To reproduce that target intentionally, type
**3000** into the **Steps** box for that run; leave it empty to use the adaptive
policy. Treat the intermediate saves — including the early ones — as candidates
to compare in Test Studio, not as proof that a specific step will be best.

**One rule applies to all of them: they are stored per DATASET, not per family.** Switching **LORA TYPE** keeps every advanced setting you had — which is what you want for rank, optimizer or resolution, and what you do **not** want for the two settings below, whose right value is different on every family. Those two are handled explicitly:

- **Memory saving carries over, and is now said out loud.** `quantize` / `quantize_te` / `low_vram` are a statement about *your card*, and your card doesn't change when the family does — so the values follow you. What changes is whether the card still suffices: switching them off on Anima or SDXL (2B, where **off** is the calibrated default) and then moving to Krea 2, FLUX.1, FLUX.2 Klein or Z-Image used to build an unquantised 12B run in complete silence. Both the panel and the **pre-launch check** now name which saver is off, what that family needs without it (see the estimates below) and what your card reports. It stays a **warning, never a blocker** — a big card legitimately runs unquantised — The warning is also *provenance-blind*: unticking a box directly on Krea 2 with a 24 GB card gets the same sentence as inheriting it from Anima, because it is the same danger.
- **Timestep weighting is remembered per family instead.** `sigmoid` is Z-Image's and FLUX.1's canonical flow-matching schedule, `linear` is Krea 2's, `weighted` is FLUX.2 Klein's and Anima's — the value has no meaning outside a family, and carrying it over changed the LoRA that came out with nothing at all to observe afterwards. Each family now keeps its own choice: switching hands the incoming family its own value (or **Auto**, its canonical default, if you never set one there), and coming back finds yours exactly where you left it. Nothing is destroyed and nothing is asked. **Existing datasets are untouched** — a dataset that never changes family keeps every setting it has, byte for byte.
- **Resolution stays global on purpose.** 768 and 1024 mean the same thing on every family, so remembering it per family would mean silently raising your 768 back to 768+1024 on a switch — a new silent change to fix an old one. The one combination that costs you (1024 on a 12B with a small card) is a pre-launch row instead, and that row no longer tells you to "drop the resolution to 768" when you are already at 768.


- **🎲 Use dataset captions** (fills `sample_prompts`) — replaces the **Preview prompts** field with up to 5 captions drawn at random from this dataset's **kept** images, so the images a run is judged by show your subject rather than the generic defaults. Always the **long** caption, the one the run actually trains on — with dual captions on, previewing the short one would judge the model against a prompt shape it never met. Click again for a new draw; it **replaces** rather than appends, so a second click is a re-roll and not a pile that overruns the field's maximum. Captions are pasted as they are: the trigger is added by the run when it is missing (concept, character) and deliberately omitted for a style dataset, so the stored text is already the right shape. Disabled, with the reason on hover, while the dataset has no captions yet.

- **Memory saving** — three switches (`quantize`, `quantize_te`, `low_vram`) that used to be hard-coded. **The defaults have not changed:** Z-Image, Krea 2, FLUX.1 and FLUX.2 Klein quantise the base model and the text encoder to `qfloat8` and stream blocks between CPU and GPU, which is what makes a 12B model train on a 24 GB card; Anima and SDXL are small enough to run without any of it. Turning them **off** trades VRAM for precision and speed — worth it only if your card is bigger than the target. As a rough order of magnitude with the savers off: **Z-Image ≈ 18 GB**, **FLUX.2 Klein 4B ≈ 14 GB**, **FLUX.2 Klein 9B ≈ 24 GB**, **Krea 2 / FLUX.1 ≈ 30 GB** (estimates: bf16 weights plus headroom, not a measurement on your exact card). The panel detects your GPU and says which side of that line you are on; if it can't (no NVIDIA card, `nvidia-smi` missing), it falls back to a generic note and blocks nothing. ⚠ **The failure mode is slowness, not a crash.** On Windows there is no clean out-of-memory error: the driver silently pages to system RAM and the run creeps along for hours. If a run that used to take 40 minutes is still going after three, put the switches back. The setting also works the other way — a small card can turn quantisation **on** for Anima or SDXL. It's recorded in each run's snapshot and in the Share config, so two runs can be compared honestly.

- **Dual captions (long + short)** — off by default. When on, the run uses ai-toolkit's native `short_and_long_captions`: every image trains with **both** its full caption and a short one (text-side augmentation, so the LoRA leans less on any single wording). The short variant is **derived from the long caption** the next time you (re-)caption — text-only, via the local vision model, honouring the same kind rules (no trigger; the identity/concept/aesthetic stays omitted) — and you can edit it per image in the **⛶** caption editor. **Not available on Krea 2 or Anima:** those families pre-cache their text embeddings and unload the text encoder, so no second caption can be encoded — the toggle is reported as ignored on the training panel and in the pre-launch check, and the run trains on the long caption alone (issue #22, reported by 1Tomber).
- **Masked training (background at 10%)** — **on by default**, and since the 28/07 wave it is stored **on the dataset** instead of in the browser you set it in. A person mask is generated for every image (rembg, CPU) and the background only weighs 10% of the loss, so the LoRA binds the identity to the subject rather than to the room. What changed and why it matters: the toggle used to be a `localStorage` preference (`trainMasked_v1`) that reached the server only as a launch parameter, so **the readiness badge could not warn about it**, opening the app **from a phone or another machine** silently reverted to the default, and the value appeared in **no run snapshot** — two runs differing only by masking looked identical when compared. All three are fixed: it is patched like any other advanced option, stamped into every run's snapshot (local **and** cloud), and the pre-flight badge now carries a **Masked training ready** row that says *rembg is not installed — this dataset is set to masked but the run trains unmasked* **before** you open the launch dialog. It is a **warning, never a blocker** (a run without masks is a valid run), and it is **not** filtered out on the cloud lane: the masks are generated locally and uploaded with the images, so rembg missing here means the run trains unmasked. **Concept and Style datasets force it off** (a person mask erases the recurring concept, and a style must be learned across the whole frame), and **slider mode** ignores masks entirely — the panel says so instead of hiding the control. **Existing datasets do not change behaviour:** an untouched dataset resolves to the historical default (on). A browser that had explicitly turned masking **off** is asked once, in the training panel, whether to carry that choice onto the dataset or keep masking on — nothing is written until you answer, in either direction.

- **Dual captions (long + short)** — off by default. When on, the run uses ai-toolkit's native `short_and_long_captions`: every image trains with **both** its full caption and a short one (text-side augmentation, so the LoRA leans less on any single wording). The short variant is **derived from the long caption** the next time you (re-)caption — text-only, via the local vision model, honouring the same kind rules (no trigger; the identity/concept/aesthetic stays omitted) — and you can edit it per image in the **⛶** caption editor. **Local training only for now:** the cloud pod's dataset upload doesn't carry the JSON caption file the short is read from, so cloud runs train on the long caption alone. **Not available on Krea 2 or Anima:** those families pre-cache their text embeddings and unload the text encoder, so no second caption can be encoded — the toggle is reported as ignored on the training panel and in the pre-launch check, and the run trains on the long caption alone (issue #22, reported by 1Tomber).

## Storage

One local disk page answers where the app writes files and how much space they use.
Opening it is cheap: large folders are measured only when you press **📏 Measure
everything**, and each row shows its effective path, what it holds, and free space
on that drive.

- **Dataset images root** → `paths.dataset_images_root`. Leave it blank for
  `<data dir>/datasets`. To change it, enter an absolute folder and press **Check
  folder**; the app proves it can write there with a temporary file. You then choose
  explicitly between moving the current files (copy first, remove the old copy only
  after the last byte lands) or adopting the new folder empty and leaving the old
  files untouched. The setting is saved only after a move finishes.
- **Trash** — **Open folder** and **Empty trash**. Everything the app deletes goes
  here first; emptying it is the one destructive action, and it asks for confirmation.
- **Run image archive** — shows its size and ceiling, with **Clear archive**. The
  archive keeps content-addressed copies used by run comparisons; clearing it keeps
  run records, settings and captions, but removed dataset images can no longer be
  shown in old comparisons.

- **What lives where** — one row per category: dataset images, image banks, bank
  source images, the trash, the run image archive, backups, the ai-toolkit
  install, the Hugging Face cache and the app's own build. Each row shows the
  **effective path**, what it holds, the free space on that drive, and a
  **movable** tag when it can be relocated from here. Rental-run staging and its
  checkpoint store exist in the backend's own map of these folders but stay off
  this tab — they are not offered as Storage controls on this fork.

### Moving a folder to another drive

Two roots can be pointed anywhere: **Dataset images root**
(`paths.dataset_images_root`) and **Video datasets** (`paths.video_datasets_dir`).
Both default to **empty → a folder inside the app's data directory**; the
field's *Reset to default* gives that implicit state back rather than writing
today's path in. (Upstream also exposes **Cloud run staging** and a
**Checkpoint store** for rented-pod training here — this fork trains locally
only, so those two stay off this tab; see Divergence 4 in FORK_NOTES.md.)

Type a path, press **Check folder**, and the app proves it can write there — by
actually writing a probe file, because permission bits lie on Windows. A relative
path, an uncreatable folder, or a target *inside* the folder it would replace is
refused with the reason. Then **you choose**, and nothing happens until you do:

- **Move what is already there** — every file is copied to the new folder first,
  and the old one is only removed once the last byte has landed. A progress bar
  shows files and percentage. If the destination drive has less free space than
  the folder needs, the button is disabled and says both numbers.
- **Start using it empty** — the new folder is used from now on. **Nothing is
  copied and nothing is deleted**: the old folder keeps its files and the app
  simply stops looking at them. On a full C: this is often the only choice that
  fits.

The setting is saved **after** the files have moved, so an interrupted move never
leaves the app pointing at a half-filled folder.

- **Dataset images root** → `paths.dataset_images_root`. Where dataset images are stored. Default **empty → `<data dir>/datasets`**. This folder (and every dataset folder under it) is refused as an **image bank** source: a bank points at a live folder and can delete from it, so the two must never share files — see *Using the app → A bank and a dataset never share files*. Moving this root onto a folder an existing bank already uses is not blocked here, but that bank will say so the next time you open it, and its 🗑 Delete rejected will be refused.
- **Video datasets** → `paths.video_datasets_dir`. The flat folders of `.mp4` clips (plus their homonym `.txt` captions) that a video bank produces when you promote a selection. Default **empty → `<data dir>/video_datasets`**. **This is where the video lane actually uses disk.** A video bank itself stores almost nothing — only timestamps and one small thumbnail per detected shot — because cutting a clip means re-encoding it, and that is paid once, at promotion, for the clips you kept.
- **Video banks (working data)** → no path setting; it follows the data directory. Holds the shot thumbnails only: never your source videos, which a bank references in place and never writes to, and never the clips, which do not exist until you promote them.

*(Upstream additionally documents a **Cloud run staging** root, a **Checkpoint
store** and "Cloud run housekeeping" for rented-pod training runs. This fork
trains locally only — see Divergence 4 in FORK_NOTES.md — so none of that
applies here.)*

### Trash and archives

- **Trash** — **Open folder** and **Empty trash**. Everything the app deletes goes here first; emptying is the one destructive action, and it asks for confirmation. It lives on the same disk as your data, so a cleanup gives space back only once you empty it.
- **Run image archive** — its size, its ceiling, and **Clear archive**. When a training run is launched, a **deduplicated** copy of the images it trains on is kept so that comparing two runs can still *show* an image you have since deleted from its dataset. Copies are **content-addressed**: relaunching an unchanged dataset stores nothing the second time, and only images that were added or re-edited cost anything. Clearing it keeps your runs, their settings and their caption text — you only lose the ability to look at images that are no longer in their dataset. The ceiling is `provenance.archive_max_gb` (see *Config-file-only settings*); past it, nothing more is stored and the compare panel says the picture is unavailable instead of showing a wrong one.
- **Back up everything** — not on this page but on the **Datasets library**: one button archives every dataset, its **training history** and your settings into a single file (⬇ download or 📂 open folder), and the library's **Import backup** restores it — datasets come back under **Trained**, not "Not trained yet". Tick **Include trained LoRAs** to bundle the (large) trained `.safetensors` too. **API keys and tokens are never included** — re-enter them on the new install. See *Using the app → Back up everything*.

### Quantize an existing model to fp8

A full-precision `.safetensors` is roughly **2.5× the size ComfyUI needs** to
generate with it. **Quantize an existing model to fp8** takes any full-precision
model already on this machine — a ~26 GB one downloaded from Hugging Face, a
checkpoint an earlier full-model run delivered, a large finetune someone shared —
and writes `<name>_fp8.safetensors` next to it, loadable with the standard *Load
Diffusion Model* node.

This is the **same tool** as the one at the bottom of a dataset's ordinary
Training panel, reachable here **without a dataset**: it was only there at
first, which nobody who simply downloaded a model ever opens.

- **The source is never modified**, and an existing output is never silently
  overwritten. The result is re-opened and its scaled tensors counted before it
  reports success — a file that cannot be read back is reported as a failure, not
  as a smaller model.
- **It refuses before you click, not after.** Type a path and the plan appears
  under the field: the source size, the name it will write, the expected size and
  how many matrices are quantized. A file that is **already quantized**, a
  **LoRA/adapter**, an output that already exists and a drive without room are
  refused *there*, with the reason, and the button stays disabled. Reading the
  plan costs a few kilobytes of file header. Every condition that would stop the
  conversion is evaluated here: a refusal that only existed at start time left
  the button enabled and landed after the user had committed.
- **The disk budget is derived, not a flat number.** The fp8 file's own ceiling
  plus 2 GB of working headroom, against the free space of the volume that
  really holds the destination (`realpath` first — model folders are often
  junctions onto another drive). A flat 30 GB floor used to refuse a 12.8 GB
  conversion on a drive with 17.6 GB free.
- **It runs on the CPU**, one conversion at a time app-wide, so it never competes
  with ComfyUI or a training run for VRAM. It is disk-bound (measured ~1.2 GB/s).
- **It runs in a separate Python**, the one that has `torch` — this app installs
  without it on purpose. See `quantize.python` in *Config-file-only settings*. An
  environment that cannot do the work is a refusal in the plan, naming what to
  install.
- **Nothing is memory-mapped.** The checkpoint is read one tensor at a time, so
  the size of the file has no bearing on whether it can be opened. Mapping a
  26 GB file used to reserve 26 GB before reading a single number, which failed
  outright — with a "paging file is too small" error — on any machine whose
  pagefile was not unusually large.
- **fp8 is a one-way, inference-only export.** A quantized file is refused as a
  training base, so keep the full-precision one if you may ever want to continue,
  merge or re-quantize that model. And this is **not** the `quantize` training
  option, which only shrinks a model in memory while it trains and writes no file.

Move or copy the result into your ComfyUI `models/diffusion_models` folder to use
it.

## Server & access

How the app binds and who can reach it. **These are the settings that need a restart** — the card shows a **Running vs Saved** banner and a **Save & restart to apply** button that does it in one click.

- **Port** → `server.port`. The port the app listens on. Default **`5050`**. Change it if something else owns the port (on macOS, port 5000 is taken by AirPlay Receiver).
- **Available on the local network** — a toggle that flips the bind host between `127.0.0.1` (this machine only, the default) and `0.0.0.0` (reachable from your LAN — phone, tablet, another PC). The token and phone controls below only appear once this is on.
- **Require an access token** → `server.require_token`. Default **off** — a home LAN is treated as trusted, so LAN access is open and there's no token to type on a phone. Turn it **on** to demand a token from remote devices; requests from localhost never need one.
  When `LDS_PUBLIC=1` this is **forced on and locked** — the switch is disabled with that reason shown, and a public bind is served with the gate on unless `LDS_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1` is set (see the environment variables above).
- **Access token** → `server.access_token`. Shown only when the token gate is on: a read-only field with **Generate new token** and **Copy**. It's persisted, so it survives restarts. Open `http://<machine>:<port>/?token=<token>` once from the remote device and a signed session cookie takes over.
- **Open it on your phone** — a card with a scannable **QR code** and copyable URLs built from this machine's real LAN IP (and Tailscale IP, if present). No guessing which address to type.
- **Open a browser tab on launch** → `server.auto_open_browser`. Default **on** — a tab opens automatically once the server is up. Turn it **off** if you keep a tab pinned: no browser lets an app reuse an already-open tab, so every restart otherwise opens a redundant new one. `LDS_NO_BROWSER=1` still overrides this for a one-off launch (see the environment-variable table above) without needing a Settings change.

**Trap:** if you launched via `start.bat` with `LDS_PORT` set, that variable can override the port in your config. The in-app **Save & restart** pins host and port for the relaunch, precisely so the restart lands on the port you chose rather than the one the script forced.

## Devices

Rent another machine’s GPU while keeping datasets on one Primary. Both installs keep their own ComfyUI / Ollama / ai-toolkit. Tailscale (or any private network) is the supported path.

There are **two ways** to use another machine's GPU, and they can coexist in the same picker:

| | Compute peer | Remote ComfyUI backend |
|---|---|---|
| On the other box | Full app install + its ComfyUI | **Only ComfyUI**, started with `--listen` |
| Auth | Join token, revocable bearer | **None — ComfyUI's API has no auth**; trusted networks only |
| Can someday run | vision / infer / training kinds | Generation only, by design |
| Setup | Join flow below | Paste a URL |

- **Role** → `cluster.role`. **`standalone`** (default) = today’s single-machine app. **`primary`** = this install owns `data/` and accepts compute peers. **`peer`** = this install only runs GPU jobs for a Primary (open the Primary’s URL in the browser to edit datasets).
- **Remote ComfyUI backends** → `cluster.backends`. Add the other machine's ComfyUI URL (e.g. `http://laptop:8188`) and it appears in the **Run on** picker — in **any** role, no Primary needed. Inputs travel over ComfyUI's `/upload/image`, results come back over `/view` and land in this machine's output folder, so downstream (dataset linking, galleries) cannot tell the render was remote. Backends render **in parallel** with this machine, and — unlike local jobs — they keep rendering while a training holds the local GPU. **Test** probes the URL before you save it.
- **Device name** → `cluster.device_name`. Label shown in the **Run on** picker (e.g. “Desktop 5090”, “G18 laptop”). Empty → hostname.
- **Primary URL / join token** (peer only) — paste the Primary’s Tailscale URL and a one-time join token from the Primary’s Devices card. After join, the peer pulls jobs outbound (sleep-friendly) and uploads results back; datasets never move.
- **Generate join token** (primary only) — mint a short-lived token, copy it once to the peer. Revoke a peer anytime; its pending jobs fail cleanly.

**How to tell a remote pass is actually running.** Three places, because a pass on another machine used to be indistinguishable from a local one:

- **On the Primary**, 📋 Activity brackets the machine on every line — `[bank · Laptop 4090] score finished` — and the running row reads `score · on Laptop 4090`. The round trip gets its own `[peer]` entries: *sending N image(s)*, then ***Laptop 4090 is running the scoring pass*** (its GPU is busy; this machine stays free), then finished or failed with the peer's reason. That middle line is the remote counterpart to the local **GPU taken exclusively** entry — a remote pass never takes this machine's GPU window, which is why the local line cannot appear for one.
- **On the peer**, its header shows a pinging **🖥 Working for Primary · <what>** chip while a job runs, and its **browser tab title** becomes `● Working — LoRA Dataset Studio` so a pinned or background tab shows it without being opened. Its own 📋 Activity lists what it claimed and finished. All three clear within a poll of the job ending.
- **In Settings → Devices**, the peer list and the peer's own worker card now refresh every few seconds while the section is open (they used to be frozen from the moment you opened it).

**ComfyUI on the peer shows nothing for ✨ Score or 👥 Group by person, and that is correct** — those passes are Python scripts that never touch ComfyUI, so its queue has nothing to display. A **generation** job sent to a peer *does* appear in that peer's ComfyUI queue.

**Limits that stay visible:**

- **A backend is only as safe as the network between you.** Raw ComfyUI has no authentication: anyone who can reach that URL can render on — and read outputs from — that machine. Tailscale or a home LAN is the intended setting; never a port forwarded to the internet. When you need a credential you can revoke, use a peer.
- **What actually travels, per device kind.** To a **peer**: generation, the bank's 🧽 Klein watermark inpaint, and the bank's two heavy passes — ✨ Score and 👥 Group by person (picked in the 🚀 Launch all / queue dialogs; the peer needs the scoring extras installed, every image crosses the network, and the embeddings cache comes home so ✂ Find crops & variants / 🔤 Find by text keep working). To an **API backend**: generation and the Klein inpaint only — bare ComfyUI has no scoring stack. Everything else — training, captioning, scan/auto-reject, 🚩 watermark detection, 📐 framing — runs on the Primary regardless of the picker, and the dialogs say so. A queued bank run aimed at a peer no longer waits for the LOCAL GPU to free up; a local one still does.
- **A backend render needs a local output folder.** The hub saves the downloaded result into its own ComfyUI output folder (Settings → Local tools) so every completion handler finds it where it always has. No folder configured → the job fails and says exactly this.
- **A peer runs what its Primary sends.** That is the whole point of renting a GPU, but it means the Primary can start processes on the peer. The peer will only run scripts that ship with its own install and only with its own configured Python — it will not run a file the Primary names — but the trust still points one way: **join only a Primary you control.**
- The peer must be **awake and online** (heartbeat ~90 s); an offline peer is greyed out in the picker.
- The models/node packs for a job must exist on **that** machine’s ComfyUI/Ollama/ai-toolkit. The Primary skips its own preflight for a remote job, so a missing model surfaces as a failed job rather than an up-front 409.
- Flipping which box is Primary does **not** migrate `data/` automatically — move the data folder or keep Primary fixed and only rent the other GPU. Shared SMB dataset mounts are not used.
- A join token is single-use and expires after 48 h. A peer's token is a **compute** credential only: it cannot mint further tokens, revoke other peers, or reach anything outside its own job endpoints.
- Remote jobs move files as copies, not over a shared mount, so each one briefly costs disk on **both** machines under `data/cluster_artifacts/`. Folders older than 48 h are swept at startup (jobs still in flight are spared whatever their age) — so restart the app occasionally if you have been renting a GPU hard, or clear that folder yourself.

## Maintenance

Keeping the **app itself** healthy: updating it, and getting a bug report out of it. No setting lives here, only actions. Everything about the **disk** — the trash, the run image archive, the dataset root and the folders that fill a drive — moved to *Storage* above, where those questions are answered together.

- **Updates** — **Check for updates** and **Update & restart**, plus a *see what's in this update* compare link. **The button adapts to how you installed.** A **git checkout** fast-forwards to the latest commits. A **packaged (ZIP) install** announces the release and its size (*Update to vX — download ~XX MB*) and shows a **live progress bar** while it downloads and installs (a release ZIP is far larger than a git pull), then backs up the current files and swaps in the new ones — keeping `data/`, `config.json`, `.env` and your `.venv` untouched — and restarts. A mid-way failure rolls back automatically, so a broken download never leaves you with a half-updated install. If the app can't identify a downloadable release (no ZIP asset, or offline), the button steps aside and links to the releases page instead of promising an update it can't perform. Separately, and unrelated to `updates.repo` below: on a git checkout, a quiet **Upstream is N commits ahead · compare »** line can appear here when [perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio) — the project this fork tracks — has commits your current build doesn't. It's informational only, with no download or restart action attached; it stays silent on a packaged install (there's no local commit to compare from), when GitHub can't be reached, and whenever upstream isn't actually ahead.
- **Back up everything** — not on this page but on the **Datasets library**: one button archives every dataset, its **training history** and your settings into a single file (⬇ download or 📂 open folder), and the library's **Import backup** restores it — datasets come back under **Trained**, not "Not trained yet". Tick **Include trained LoRAs** to bundle the (large) trained `.safetensors` too. **API keys and tokens are never included** — re-enter them on the new install. See *Using the app → Back up everything*.
- **Diagnostic report** — a one-click, **paste-safe** report for bug reports: it carries the version, capability status and a log tail, with **no secrets** and file paths reduced to booleans (present/absent). Safe to drop into Discord or a GitHub issue. If your browser refuses the clipboard — which it does on any address that is not HTTPS or `localhost`, so on the LAN address you use from another machine — the report is shown in a selected box to copy by hand instead of being lost. See *Getting help → Or let the app write it for you*.
- **Stop everything** — one action for when something did not fire correctly and the app is stuck. It cancels queued and running bank passes, dataset batches and in-flight generations, asks ComfyUI to unload its models, stops training, and then clears the two flags the "GPU busy" refusal reads. It **confirms first** — it is destructive to in-flight work by design — and it reports **per target**: an unreachable ComfyUI is *not confirmed*, not "stopped", and a training process that cannot be confirmed dead is a failure whose flag is deliberately left set. Above it, a warning appears **only when the server has checked and found nothing behind a "GPU busy" flag**, offering to clear it alone — that stops nothing and is the fix in the common case. The same warning shows on the bank workspace and the banks page, where the refusal is actually met. See *Troubleshooting → "GPU busy" when nothing is running*.

## Per-dataset settings

Separate from everything above: these live **per dataset**, in the **⚙ Dataset settings** modal you open from the workspace. They travel with that one dataset and don't touch the global Settings page.

- **Name** — the dataset's display name. **Display only** for Character and Concept datasets: it never appears in a file name, so changing it touches nothing on disk (the *trigger word* names produced files — see below). **On a Style dataset it means more**: a Style is always-on and has no visible trigger, so its name is its only editable identity — renaming it also renames the LoRAs, run folder and export it already produced (and is refused while a run is live, same as a trigger change).
- **Dataset kind** *(🧑 Character / 💡 Concept / 🎨 Style)* — the nature of the LoRA, chosen at creation but changeable here. It is the disruptive setting, so picking a different pill reveals a confirmation block that spells out **what changes** and **what is kept** before you save:
  - *What changes* — the **caption strategy** (Character leaves out identity; Concept leaves out the recurring concept; Style leaves out the aesthetic), which **panels show** (Reference photo, Generate variations and Face analysis are Character-only — they appear when you become a Character and are hidden otherwise), the **trigger's role** (Style has none; switching to Character/Concept brings the field back, prefilled), and Character-only settings such as **face/body fidelity**. Switching **to Concept** requires a concept description.
  - *What is kept* — **nothing is deleted.** Every image, its caption text, keep/reject status, face scores, watermark work and **training history** stay exactly as they are (past runs are named by the model family and trigger, never the kind). A concept description is remembered so switching back restores it.
  - Existing captions were written for the **old** kind and are **not** rewritten automatically — use **🔄 Re-caption** in the Captions section to apply the new strategy. The switch is refused while the dataset has work in progress (generation, captioning or a quality pass) — wait for it to finish.
- **Trigger word** — the word you put in prompts to summon this LoRA (Character and Concept datasets). Safe to change anytime — it's added at export, so existing captions don't need redoing. It is also **the name everything this dataset produces carries** (the deployed LoRA, the training run folder, the export, the job config), so changing it **renames all of them to match** and repoints the Test Studio history and cloud runs at the new names — a toast tells you how many files moved. Two guards: if the new trigger is already used on disk by another dataset, **nothing** is renamed (never half a set) and the old names are kept; and the change is **refused while a training run is live**, because that run folder is what training resumes from — stop it or let it finish first. **Style datasets don't have one**: Style is always-on, and the modal shows a note reminding you to control the effect with the LoRA weight instead.
- **Concept description** *(Concept datasets only)* — the thing the LoRA learns, i.e. exactly what captions must **omit**. Editing it rebuilds the caption avoid-list, so **re-caption** afterwards to apply the new list to images already captioned.
- **Subject type** *(Human / Animal / Creature / Object / Other / Anime)* — **what your reference actually is**, chosen right in the **🎬 Generate variations** panel (it travels with the dataset). It is **orthogonal to the dataset kind**: a specific dog is *Character + Animal*, "dogs in general" is *Concept + Animal*. Anything other than **Human** switches two things so the generated shots stop assuming a person: the **shot catalogue** (an animal gets head / half-body / full-body / rear shots, an object gets front / angle / detail / rear views — the group headers relabel to match) and the **identity lock** the engine is given (a dog keeps its breed, coat and markings; a product keeps its shape, material and logo — instead of "same face, jawline, skin tone"). Each type ships its own balanced preset. **Human is the default and existing datasets are unchanged.** *(NSFW body shots stay Human-only.)* First-draft prompt sets — refine per subject as needed. Inspired by a community request.

  **Anime** is the one type where the *rendering* is part of the subject, so it behaves differently from the other five on purpose:

  - Its **identity lock** protects a character *design* rather than a photographed body — hair colour, hairstyle and silhouette, eye shape and iris colour, the **signature outfit and its colours**, the accessories (ribbon, hairpin, glasses, ears, tail) and the distinctive marks — **plus the art style itself** (line work, cel shading, palette). It then does what no other lock does: it **explicitly forbids** turning the character into a photograph, a 3D render or a real person (no skin texture, no pores, no film grain). Every other type ends its prompt with *"professional realistic photograph"*; for a drawing that instruction destroys the subject, so for Anime the engine is asked for an **anime illustration** instead — in the opening command and in the closing style tag alike.
  - The **signature outfit counts as identity**. For a Human dataset the app deliberately varies clothing on every shot (so a jacket never binds to the person); for a character the costume is half of what makes them recognisable, so the shots keep it. Two explicit *alternate outfit* cards let you vary it when you want to.
  - Its **shot catalogue** (55 shots) uses the vocabulary of the medium — **bust-up**, **cowboy shot** (knee-up), full body, a full **expression sheet** (smile, laughing, angry, surprised, blushing, eyes closed) and a **front / side / back character-sheet turnaround** on a plain background that no other type offers. Four presets: *Balanced*, *Face & expressions*, *Full body focused* and *Character sheet*.
  - It pairs naturally with the **Anima** training family (see *Default training family* above), though the two settings are independent — you can build an anime dataset and train it on any family.
- **Prompt suffixes** *(collapsible — optional creative direction)* — free text appended to **generated** variations at generation time, to steer a global look without rewriting anything:
  - **All shots** → `prompt_suffix` — one global suffix (e.g. *"shot on 35mm film, warm tones"*), up to **300 characters**.
  - **Face / Bust / Body / Back shots** → `prompt_suffixes` — one suffix per framing, up to **300 characters** each. A framing suffix applies to that shot type first, then the global one.

  Key behaviours: these are **applied at generation time and never stored into a tile's own prompt** (so a regenerate can't double-apply them), the **identity lock always comes first** — a suffix can't override it, clearing a field removes that suffix, and existing images stay as they are until you **regenerate** to apply.

  You can also edit the very same suffixes **inline in the generation panel** (the collapsible *✨ Prompt suffixes* row under the shot picker), which is handy for tuning them **per batch** without opening this modal — both surfaces read and write the one dataset value, and an edit made there is saved the moment you press **Generate**.

## Config-file-only settings

These have no UI control — they're for advanced users editing `config.json` by hand (copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` first). Most people never touch them; the defaults are tuned. Values below are the shipped defaults.

*(The four ComfyUI folder overrides used to live here. They are now editable in **Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI → Advanced: ComfyUI folder overrides** — see that section above. Values set by hand in `config.json` are unaffected: the same keys, read the same way, now simply shown in the app.)*

*(Upstream also documents a router-model config key here for its ChatGPT
subscription lane — Divergence 1: this fork carries no cloud image engines, so
that key does not exist here.)*

**Shot detection (video bank):** the boundary detector that cuts a long source into
individual shots. No UI control yet — the defaults are the reference
implementation's, and neither of the two numbers below has been measured against
this app's material, so they are stated as adjustable rather than tuned.

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `shot_detect.python` | `''` | Interpreter that runs the detector. Empty means **reuse the Bank scoring environment**, which already carries torch — a second copy would cost you ~2.5 GB for nothing. Written by the installer; you rarely set it by hand. |
| `shot_detect.threshold` | `0.5` | Cut probability above which a frame is treated as a shot boundary — the app-wide **default**. A bank can override it, and a single file inside that bank can override the bank; both live in the bank's own **🎬 Find shots** panel, where a preview says how many shots each value would give before anything is cut. 0.5 is the detector paper's own number and the paper never justifies it, so it is a convention rather than a measurement: on single-take footage 0.6–0.7 invents fewer cuts, on tight edits a lower value finds more. |
| `shot_detect.min_shot_seconds` | `0.6` | Shortest shot worth offering, as a **duration** — converted to frames through each file's own rate, so it means the same thing on a 25 fps rush and a 60 fps one. |
| `shot_detect.min_shot_frames` | *(unset)* | The old floor, in frames. Still honoured, and still never renamed: if you set this and not `min_shot_seconds`, yours wins. Left unset, `min_shot_seconds` decides. It shipped at 5, which is 0.08 s at 60 fps — nobody chose that, which is why the setting moved to seconds. |
| `shot_detect.short_shot_policy` | `drop` | `drop` \| `merge`. What happens to a shot below the floor. `drop` loses the footage; `merge` glues it onto the previous shot (onto the next one when it is the file's first). A merge deletes exactly one boundary and moves none of the others, so the cuts you keep are always a subset of what the detector drew. `drop` is the default because it is what shipped. |
| `shot_detect.dissolve_min_frames` | `5` | At or above this width, a boundary is labelled **dissolve** rather than **cut** on the shot's tile. Read from the detector's second output, which the app used to compute and throw away. **Not measured on real footage** — it follows from how the network was trained, and it is a setting precisely so a future calibration is a number rather than a patch. Advisory: the label changes nothing about the cut. |
| `shot_detect.trim_dissolves` | `false` | Pull a shot's bounds inside the dissolves at its ends (half the fade on each side), so a clip does not open on a cross-fade of the previous shot. **Off by default**, and it should stay off until the width rule above has been checked on real footage: turning it on moves every dissolve boundary in every bank you detect afterwards. |
| `shot_detect.device` | `auto` | `auto` \| `cuda` \| `cpu`. The network runs on 48×27 frames and is never the bottleneck — decoding is. CPU is a perfectly reasonable choice, and it leaves the GPU free for captioning and training. |

**Video bank quality cuts:** the thresholds behind the video bank's amber flags.
The cuts that describe your *footage* default to **empty = no cut** — that is a
decision, not an omission: published thresholds measurably do not transfer between
collections, so the app never ships one. `watermark_max` is the exception and the
reason is worth knowing: it does not measure your footage, it reads a *classifier's*
probability, which is calibrated with the model rather than with your material — so
the image lane's measurement transfers where a motion floor does not. The three
🔳 Safe zone rows follow the same rule: they measure your
footage, so they ship empty and quote their published references instead. The
three 🩻 Defects rows are the newest, and they are empty for a reason one step
further along: `block_max` and `blur_max` are raw ffmpeg filter outputs whose
absolute value depends heavily on *what is in the frame*, so there is no
published figure worth quoting either — the signal is in the spread inside one
bank, which is what **Preview** is for. `motion_irregularity_floor` is the last
row and the odd one twice over: it is the only cut here whose **low** side is the
suspect one, and the only one whose method publishes *no threshold at all* —
rank metrics need no absolute scale, so there is nothing to borrow even in
principle. Set them from
**Video bank → 🎚 Quality cuts**, where **Preview** shows how many shots each value
would flag before you apply it. Raw scores stay stored, so changing any of these
re-sorts every bank instantly, without rescanning.

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `video_bank.min_duration_s` | *(empty)* | Flags shots shorter than this, in seconds (`brief`). The only cut here that needs no measuring pass — it reads the shot bounds, so it works straight after detection. Not the same thing as the promotion's `too short` refusal, which is your target profile's own arithmetic and no setting moves it; this one only decides what gets flagged for your eyes. |
| `video_bank.motion_floor` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose average motion falls below this (`still`). |
| `video_bank.motion_ceiling` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose busiest moments exceed this (`agitated`). |
| `video_bank.luma_floor` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose darkest frame falls below this brightness (`black`). |
| `video_bank.freeze_max` | *(empty)* | Flags shots where more than this share of frames do not move (`freeze`). |
| `video_bank.sharpness_floor` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose sharpest stretch stays below this (`soft`). |
| `video_bank.watermark_max` | `0.94` | Flags shots whose watermark score exceeds this (`watermark`), after the **🔖 Watermarks** pass has scored them. This model's scores are compressed hard against 1, so 0.94 is the measured cut and not the 0.5 a probability normally implies — on a 110-image hand-labelled sample it flagged none of the 55 clean images and still caught 54 of the 55 marked ones. Lower it toward 0.92 to catch the faintest marks and hand-check a few clean shots. A shot the pass has not judged carries no score and is **never** flagged — that is "not evaluated", not "clean". Set it to empty to flag nothing. |
| `video_bank.aesthetic_floor` | *(empty)* | Flags shots the LAION aesthetic head rates below this (`low_aesthetic`) — the same model and the same ~1–10 scale the image bank's **✨ Score** puts on a still. Shots are rated by **🔎 Find scenes**, which reads the frame vectors it already caches, so the rating costs no decode and no GPU; re-run it on an already-embedded bank and the whole thing is rated in seconds. **Empty on purpose**, unlike `watermark_max`: a watermark score is a classifier's probability, calibrated with the model, while this is a *taste* rating whose useful cut depends on the corpus. The published LAION references — 4 casual, 4.75 strict — were chosen to filter a web crawl, and deliberately-shot rushes sit well above both, so **Preview** 4 against your own bank before applying it. A shot with no rating carries no score and is **never** flagged. |
| `video_bank.bars_max` | *(empty)* | Flags shots where more than this share of the frame is a flat band — letterbox, pillarbox, or a vertical video padded into a wide container (`letterboxed`), after the **🔳 Safe zone** pass has measured them. The share is the larger of *(top + bottom)* and *(left + right)*, the same arithmetic — and the same meaning — as the image bank's `bank.bars_max`, so a number you calibrated on stills carries over. **Empty on purpose** even though the image lane ships `0.04`: a 2.35:1 film honestly carries about `0.12` of bands and is not a defect, it is a crop waiting to happen. The pass calls a band *structural* only when it is present on all three frames it looks at, so a fade-out never creates one; a genuinely flat sky or the surround of a dark-themed screen recording still can, which is the other reason there is no default. A shot the pass has not measured is **never** flagged. |
| `video_bank.text_coverage_max` | *(empty)* | Flags shots where burned-in text covers more than this share of the frame (`burned_text`). Only text that stays put **across** the shot's three frames counts — a subtitle, a chyron, a lower third, a text watermark — so a shop sign or a newspaper someone holds up is scene content and is never counted. `0.01` is already a full subtitle line, so this cut lives at small values. Reading text needs the **Burned-in text** extra from Setup (RapidOCR, CPU only, ~16 MB of weights inside the wheel). Without it the pass still measures bands, records `safe_zone_state: bars_only`, and stores **no** text reading at all — so this cut flags nothing rather than clearing every shot. |
| `video_bank.safe_area_min` | *(empty)* | Flags shots where cropping away both the bands **and** the burned-in text would leave less than this share of the frame (`small_safe_zone`). This is where text in the MIDDLE of a frame lands: it is small, so the share above never catches it, and there is no crop that removes it — the rectangle collapses and this number goes with it. HunyuanVideo 1.5 keeps only clips whose crop leaves 60 % or more of the frame; below roughly 50 % there is not enough picture left to be worth the trouble. Both figures were set for a web-scale crawl, which is why they are quoted here and shipped nowhere. Needs the text extra, like the row above. |
| `video_bank.dup_frames_max` | *(empty)* | Flags shots where more than this share of frames is a near-copy of the one before it (`dup_frames`), after the **🩻 Defects** pass has swept the file. This is what a 24 fps source uploaded as 30 fps looks like — one frame in five is a repeat, so `0.15` catches it — and it is **not** `freeze_max` under another name: that one reads the codec's motion vectors and says *nothing moved*, this one says *the same picture was delivered twice*. A moving shot run through a frame-rate conversion trips this and leaves `freeze_max` completely untouched. Measured over the shot's own window, so a shot straddling a frozen stretch reports the share it actually holds. |
| `video_bank.block_max` | *(empty)* | Flags shots where the 8×8 macroblock grid shows through a hard squeeze (`blocky`), read as the worst tenth of the shot's sampled frames. **Empty on purpose, and here there is not even a published figure to quote:** the score depends on what is *in* the frame nearly as much as on the damage. Measured on this machine, the same scene from a good encode to a ruined one moved from **13 to 43**, while four *different* scenes at one fixed quality spanned **1 to 25 000**. So the signal is in the spread inside one bank, never in the number — use **Preview**, look at what a value caught, and move it. Worth reading next to the file card's **bits per pixel**, which predicts the same damage from the container header alone. |
| `video_bank.blur_max` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose edges stay wide even at their sharpest (`blurry`), measured at **full resolution**. This is the cut that catches footage **upscaled from something smaller**, and `sharpness_floor` above structurally cannot: that one computes its Laplacian on a 160-pixel-wide analysis copy (deliberately — a Laplacian over a full frame costs more than the decode), and at 160 pixels a 480p upscale and the genuine 1080p are the same picture. Measured on three files carrying the same footage: `sharpness_p90` read **354.35 / 353.69 / 353.72** for native, 480p-upscaled and 320p-upscaled, while this score read **5.56 / 6.62 / 7.35**. Typical values are 4–6 for clean footage and 7–12 for upscaled or heavily squeezed material. Deliberately read from the **sharpest** tenth of the shot rather than the blurriest, so a fast pan or a shallow depth of field is not called blurry — the same false positive `sharpness_floor` chose its own aggregation to avoid. |
| `video_bank.motion_irregularity_floor` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose motion is suspiciously **smooth** (`maybe_generated`), after the **🤖 AI check** pass has measured them. **The only cut in this table whose low side is the suspect one** — it is a floor, so raising it flags more, and reading it as a `_max` would flag every handheld shot in your bank while clearing every generated one. The score is the spread of the *change in* frame-to-frame change over two contiguous seconds: real footage is erratic (a hand shakes, a subject accelerates, the sensor is noisy) and generated footage tends to be smoother than the world. **How reliable, honestly: about three shots in four.** The SAFE Challenge evaluated detectors blind and the best system scored `0.86` balanced accuracy on untouched video against `0.74` on post-processed video, with re-compression alone moving AUC from `0.88` to `0.77` — and scraped material is re-compressed by construction. The method behind this was measured only against 2023–24 generators (ModelScope, Gen2, Pika, LaVie, Sora, CogVideoX…), says nothing about Sora 2, Veo 3, Kling or Wan 2.5, and is *worst on the cheapest fakes*: on one generator whose output is incoherent it scores below chance, because chaotic generation reads as more real than clean generation. So this is advisory, and nothing in the app rejects or deletes on it. **There is no value to type and no published one to borrow:** the method reports only rank metrics (AUC, average precision) and its reference implementation carries no threshold at all, while the score's scale moves with the encoder and the frame count. **Preview** against your own bank. Shots shorter than about `2.4` s hold no window, carry `ai_check_state: too_short` and no score, and are never flagged. Not the same claim as the image bank's `origin: ai`, which reads generator metadata and is proof when present; this reads pixels and infers. |
| `video_bank.camera_shake_max` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose camera wobbles more than this (`shaky`), after the **🎥 Camera** pass has read them. The number is the high-frequency part of the movement — what a local average of the trajectory cannot explain — as a **percentage of the frame width**, so unlike every other cut in this table it is *comparable between banks*: it does not move with resolution, content or encoder. For scale, a smoothly-moved or locked-off shot measures under `0.10` and strong handheld tremor measures about `1.16`, so a cut around `0.3` separates them. **Empty on purpose, and for a reason none of the rows above have:** the number is calibrated, but *which side of it you want* is the whole question — filtering **for** the wobble is exactly how you build a handheld-look training set, and a default would pick a side this app does not have. **Not the same threshold as the `Handheld` camera label**, which fires at a fixed internal floor: the label says what the shot *is*, this cut says what *you* reject, so a shot can be labelled handheld without being flagged and the reverse. A shot the pass has not read is **never** flagged. |
| `video_bank.coherence_floor` | *(empty)* | Flags shots whose first and last embedded frames have drifted far enough apart that the shot probably holds a **cut the detector missed** (`missed_cut`) — one "shot" that is really two scenes. The number is the CLIP cosine between those two frames, so `1.00` is *the same picture* and lower means *the scene changed*. It is produced at the tail of **🔎 Find scenes** from vectors that pass already cached: no decode, no model, no GPU, no button — and re-running **🔎 Find scenes** on an already-embedded bank reads the whole thing in seconds. **Empty on purpose, and here the reason is neither "it is your footage" nor "there is no published figure" — it is that the measured accuracy does not earn a default.** Calibrated on this app's own encoder against 362 forged missed cuts (two adjacent detected shots fused into one) and 337 real shots, controlled for duration: **AUC 0.719**, and a cut at `0.80` catches about a third of the missed cuts while flagging about one honest shot in seven; `0.75` catches a fifth for one in ten. That is worth **sorting** a bank by and not worth deciding anything on. **Why long shots score lower:** the cosine falls with elapsed time whether or not anything was cut (measured: Spearman −0.41 against duration), so a twenty-second locked-off take can read `0.84` with no cut in it — lower the floor if your bank is mostly long takes. **Panda-70M's own `1.0` does not convert into a default here:** that is a Euclidean distance over ImageBind features, which is cosine `0.5` on unit vectors, and `0.5` sits below the first percentile of even completely unrelated CLIP ViT-L/14 frame pairs (measured: p1 `0.501`, median `0.720`) — it would flag nothing, ever. **Not a stillness cut, deliberately:** the other half of Panda's rule ("nothing changed, so nothing moved") was measured against this app's own motion readings and refuted — the number tracks shot *length* far more than motion, genuinely motionless shots read no higher than ordinary ones, and stillness stays with `motion_floor` and the **Slideshow** camera label. Shots with no vectors, and shots under a second (too short for the embed pass to take more than one frame), carry no reading and are **never** flagged. |
| `video_bank.duplicate_threshold` | `0.96` | Cosine similarity at or above which two shots are grouped as near-duplicates by the **✂ Duplicates** pass, comparing them at their closest pair of embedded frames. Not a read-time cut like the rows above: changing it means re-running that pass — which is instant and costs no GPU, since it re-reads the frame vectors **🔎 Find scenes** already cached. **Where the number comes from:** it is inherited from the image bank's `bank.semantic_dup_threshold`, measured over the *same* CLIP space, and no video-pair calibration exists yet. Comparing shots at their closest frame pair also reaches any given value more easily than a single-image comparison does, so **raise** it if your bank over-groups. |

**Imported shot catalogs** — written by the workspace, not meant to be hand-edited (see *Using the app → Your own shot catalog*), but this is where they live so you know what to back up:

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `custom_shots` | `{}` | `{subject_type: [{id, label, prompt, framing, nsfw?}]}` — the shots you imported from JSON, one list per subject type. Kept here rather than in the browser so they survive a cache wipe, follow you to another device and ride along in the backup. Entries are re-checked on read: a bad `framing`, a missing field, or a `label` that already belongs to a built-in shot is dropped (two shots sharing a label would resolve to the wrong prompt when one is regenerated). |

**Cloud (vast.ai) internals** — knobs for after the real-world smoke test. This fork exposes no cloud settings in the UI at all, so these sit alongside the `cloud.*` guard-rails above rather than behind them:

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `cloud.template_hash` | `471ed5903d8cdb8e63b0d0e50f6cd519` | The official vast.ai "Ostris AI Toolkit" template. Clearing it falls back to a raw-image launch. |
| `cloud.ui_port` | `18675` | Container port the pod UI is proxied on. |
| `cloud.image` | `vastai/ostris-ai-toolkit:…` | Raw-image fallback (used only when the template is cleared). |
| `cloud.offer_scan_limit` | `100` | How many offers are fetched when listing GPU speed tiers. |
| `cloud.pod_overhead_minutes` | `35` | Boot + model download + quantize time built into cost estimates. |
| `cloud.min_inet_down_mbps` | `400` | Skip hosts too slow to pull the image. |
| `cloud.min_disk_bw_mbps` | `500` | Skip hosts too slow to extract it. |
| `cloud.host_blacklist_days` | `3` | How long to skip a host whose pod showed no sign of booting. |
| `cloud.slow_boot_blacklist_hours` | `6` | Shorter skip for a host that was still visibly booting when the boot ceiling cut it — slow, not broken. |
| `cloud.ready_timeout_minutes` | `25` | **Idle** boot budget: the clock restarts every time the pod shows a boot fact it had never shown before (a new vast status, the UI port getting published, a moving host progress line), so an honest multi-gigabyte image pull is never cut. Only a pod that shows nothing new for this long is terminated. |
| `cloud.boot_budget_minutes` | `90` | **Absolute** ceiling on the boot phase. Because progress restarts the timeout above, a host too slow to ever finish would keep your rental alive; past this it is terminated regardless (`0` = no ceiling). |
| `cloud.disk_gb` | `60` | Instance disk (base model + dataset + checkpoints). |
| `cloud.min_vram_gb` | `{zimage:24, sdxl:16, krea:24, flux2klein:32}` | Minimum VRAM **per family**. flux2klein uses 32 (the 9B is the cloud-first lane; a 32 GB pod also trains the 4B). |
| `cloud.onstart` | `''` | Optional startup command for the raw-image fallback. |

**Quality-tool interpreters and models:**

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `face_scoring.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the InsightFace subprocess (empty = current interpreter). |
| `face_scoring.models_root` | `''` | Where InsightFace weights are stored/downloaded. |
| `face_scoring.device` | `'auto'` | Device for BOTH face passes — the Image bank's person grouping and a dataset's 🎭 Analyze faces. `auto` uses the GPU when the face interpreter exposes CUDA (needs `onnxruntime-gpu` installed in it) and falls back to CPU otherwise; `cpu` forces CPU (never touches the GPU); `cuda` requests the GPU but still falls back to CPU when unavailable. A GPU run is serialized through the GPU-exclusive window so it never competes with a training/scoring pass. |
| `bank_scoring.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the Image-bank Score pass (aesthetic / NSFW / style). Empty = current interpreter until Setup installs the managed `data/envs/bank_scoring` venv and records its path here. |
| `bank_scoring.models_root` | `''` | Optional cache root for Score-pass model weights. |
| `masks.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the rembg (person-mask) subprocess. |
| `wd14.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the 🔖 WD14 tagger subprocess. Empty = reuse `masks.python`, then the current interpreter — the tagger needs only `onnxruntime`, which any environment carrying rembg or InsightFace already has. |
| `wd14.models_root` | `''` | Where the WD14 model files (`model.onnx` + `selected_tags.csv`, ~400 MB) are stored. Empty = `data/models/wd14`. |
| `wd14.threshold` | `0.35` | Confidence at or above which a tag is kept when the 🔖 Tags pass runs (clamped to 0.05–0.95). The **full** scored output is stored regardless, so this only decides what a pass writes — it does not have to be right first time. |
| `bank_scoring.text_search_idle_minutes` | `10` | How long the 🔤 **Find by text** encoder stays warm after its last query (capped at `120`). Loading CLIP costs ~10 s on the CPU; encoding a phrase afterwards costs ~20 ms, so the worker is kept alive to make a refine-and-retry session instant. It holds roughly **2.4 GB of RAM** while it lives, and is released when you close the search panel or when the window elapses. Set to `0` to never keep it warm. Text caches are separated by engine/model key and already-searched phrases are cached on disk regardless. |
| `bank_semantic.python` | `''` | Interpreter for SigLIP 2 image/text workers and capability probes. Setup installs SigLIP 2 into `data/envs/bank_scoring` and records that managed Python here without changing `bank_scoring.python` (so a borrowed GPU Score runtime stays selected and untouched). You can also point it at a CUDA interpreter you already have, from the Bank's **Semantic engine** panel (**GPU Python I already have**) - an EXECUTION choice only: Setup's Install/repair keeps targeting the managed environment and now preserves your pick instead of overwriting it. The check uses SigLIP 2's own dependency list (`torch`, a `transformers` carrying `Siglip2Model`, `numpy`, `Pillow`) - no `open_clip`, no `timm`. Empty keeps backward compatibility: use `bank_scoring.python`, then the app Python. |
| `bank_semantic.models_root` | `''` | SigLIP 2 model cache (empty = `data/models/bank_semantic`). Setup downloads only the pinned files after an explicit click; inference is local-files-only. |
| `bank_semantic.device` | `'auto'` | Device for the SigLIP 2 image index (`auto`, `cuda`, `cpu`). Resolved against `bank_semantic.python`: `auto` only reaches the GPU if THAT interpreter's torch sees a card, which is what the Semantic engine panel's device line reports. A GPU run uses the same exclusive window as other Bank ML work. |
| `bank_semantic.siglip2_semantic_dup_threshold` | `0.97` | SigLIP 2 cosine threshold for **✂ Find crops & variants**. Separate from CLIP because the two spaces are not numerically interchangeable. |
| `watermark.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the LaMa watermark subprocess. **Auto-managed:** leave it empty and the **Install inpainting** button builds a dedicated Python 3.10-3.12 environment for you (`simple-lama-inpainting` needs Pillow&lt;10, so it can't share the app's own Python) and fills this in automatically. Set it yourself only to point at an environment you already have — a manual value is always respected and never overwritten. |

**Klein consistency LoRA:**

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `klein.consistency_lora` | `klein/Flux2-Klein-9B-consistency-V2.safetensors` | The structure-anchoring LoRA on the Klein edit graph, relative to ComfyUI's LoRA folder. |
| `klein.consistency_strength` | `0.5` | Its strength (0–1). Its own guide warns 0.8–1.0 can stop edits applying; `0` disables it entirely. |

**Z-Image text encoder & VAE:**

Both are **blank by default, and blank is the right value** — the app finds them itself. It scans every registered `vae` / `text_encoders` folder (including the ones your `extra_model_paths.yaml` adds), sub-folders included, ignoring capitalisation and separators: `z_ae`, `z ae`, `z-ae`, and ComfyUI's own `ae.safetensors` all resolve, and `qwen_3_4b.safetensors` is found whether it sits at the root of `text_encoders/` or inside a folder called `Z image`, `Z Image` or `z-image`. It never picks a `.gguf` (the loader nodes cannot open one) and never picks Krea's `qwen3vl_4b` or Klein's `qwen_3_8b`, which live in the same folder and would fail at sample time.

Set one of these **only** to override that search — for instance if your ComfyUI is shared with FLUX.1, whose VAE is also called `ae.safetensors`, and the app picked the wrong one. A value you set here is used exactly as written and is never second-guessed; if the file isn't there, the error names *your* file rather than silently substituting another.

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `zimage.vae` | `''` | Pin the Z-Image VAE, relative to ComfyUI's VAE folder (e.g. `z_ae.safetensors`). Blank = auto-resolve. |
| `zimage.text_encoder` | `''` | Pin the Z-Image text encoder, relative to ComfyUI's text-encoders folder (e.g. `Z image/qwen_3_4b.safetensors`). Blank = auto-resolve. |

**Updates:**

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `updates.repo` | `socrasteeze/lora-dataset-studio` | The GitHub repo the update checker reads its release feed from. Point it at a fork and **Update & restart** follows that fork; point it at upstream from a fork and the next upstream release will look like an update and replace your build with theirs. |

**Run provenance:**

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `provenance.archive_max_gb` | `5` | Ceiling of the **run image archive** (Settings → Storage): the deduplicated copies that let a two-run comparison still show an image you deleted afterwards. Copies are content-addressed, so a whole training history usually costs well under a gigabyte — on a real 20-dataset, 1471-image library, every distinct version of every image ever trained came to about **0.5 GB**. Past the ceiling nothing more is stored and the compare panel says so. Set it to `0` to turn archiving off entirely; the run records, settings and caption text are kept either way. |

**Cloud training (vast.ai) — dormant in this fork.** These keys are upstream's and are documented for completeness only. There is **no rented-GPU lane here**: no rental card in Settings → Training, no ☁ launch button, and the **Runs** hub filters cloud rows out entirely, so a cloud run cannot be started, continued, retried or even listed. Setting `VAST_API_KEY` does **not** switch any of it back on — the capability is forced off in the UI. The backend module is kept only so the fork does not diverge from upstream on a file it never runs.

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `VAST_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Secret, in `.env`. Upstream requires it for cloud training; setting it here enables nothing. |
| `cloud.max_concurrent_runs` | `1` | Simultaneous cloud pods allowed (1–10). |
| `cloud.max_price_per_hour` | `0.80` | Safety cap on the hourly offer price in $; pricier hosts are skipped before launch. |
| `cloud.monthly_budget_usd` | `0` | Hard monthly spend ceiling in $ (`0` = unlimited); launches are blocked past it. |
| `cloud.stall_timeout_minutes` | `30` | Kill + rescue a cloud run after this many minutes without step progress. |
| `cloud.unreachable_grace_minutes` | `6` | How long a running pod may stay unreachable (a vast.ai network blackout, measured as real consecutive silence) before the run is given up and auto-retried on a fresh host. Raise it if healthy runs die with *pod unreachable*. It also bounds the **reconnection after an app restart**: a run whose job was already training is given this long to answer again — asked directly, not through the vast.ai listing — before it is given up, and the pod is never told to stop on a verdict reached without reaching it. |
| `cloud.min_reliability` | `0.98` | vast.ai host-reliability floor (0.9–0.999); lower surfaces cheaper, riskier hosts. |
| `cloud.verified_only` | `true` | Restrict to vast.ai verified hosts. |
| `cloud.secure_cloud_only` | `false` | Restrict to vast.ai's Secure Cloud (datacenter) tier (narrows the market, raises price). |

## config.json key reference (all keys)

A flat cheat-sheet of the main `config.json` keys, for quick lookup or hand-editing (copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` first — it's git-ignored, in your data directory). Every key here is documented in full, with defaults and traps, in the sections above; this table is the index. **Secrets** (`HF_TOKEN`, `VAST_API_KEY`, optional scraper credentials) live in `.env`, not here. This fork has no `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` — the cloud image-generation engines were removed; Klein/ComfyUI is the only generation path.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `server.host` | Interface the Flask server binds to (default `127.0.0.1`, local-only). |
| `server.port` | Port the server listens on (default `5050`). |
| `server.require_token` | On a non-loopback bind, require remote clients to present an access token (default `false` — a trusted LAN needs none). Toggle and token also live in Settings → Server & access. Overridden to always-on by `LDS_PUBLIC=1`. |
| `console.level` | What the start.bat / run.py terminal narrates from the activity log: `off` (silent), `events` (default — one line per state change), `heartbeat` (plus a line per running job every `console.heartbeat_seconds`), `all` (plus progress ticks, throttled to at most one per job per second). Same events the 📋 Activity panel shows. Overridable by `LDS_CONSOLE`. Config.json only — no Settings UI. |
| `console.heartbeat_seconds` | Interval for heartbeat lines when `console.level` is `heartbeat` or `all` (default `30`, clamped 5–600). |
| `diagnostics.db_trace_seconds` | Seconds a database write may be held before the log reports which thread is holding it and what opened it. `0` (default) = off. The database allows one writer at a time, so a background pass that holds it too long makes everything else — a ✓ on an image, a second machine's check-in — fail with "the database is busy". This is how you find out which pass. Turn it on only while investigating; it costs nothing when off but adds a log line per slow write when on. Overridable by `LDS_DB_TRACE`. Config.json only — no Settings UI. |
| `paths.dataset_images_root` | Where dataset images are stored. Empty string defaults to `<data dir>/datasets`. |
| `paths.cloud_runs_dir` | Working area of cloud training runs (dataset copy, samples, logs). Empty string defaults to `<data dir>/cloud_runs`. |
| `paths.checkpoints_dir` | Durable store for the checkpoints cloud runs produce. Empty string defaults to `<data dir>/checkpoints`. No cleanup ever removes a file from it. |
| `paths.video_datasets_dir` | Where promoted video datasets are written — a flat folder of `.mp4` clips with homonym `.txt` captions per dataset. Empty string defaults to `<data dir>/video_datasets`. |
| `dataset_import.max_side` | Longest side for opt-in WebP normalization (default `1024`; `0` = original size). It is ignored by the default `preserve` mode; ratio is always preserved, never enlarged, and normalized paths clamp at 8192 px. Every source must still fit `image_input.*` below; a larger one is rejected and must be resized before import (or the budget raised). Not retroactive. Editable in Settings → Captioning & quality. |
| `dataset_import.encoding` | How an un-cropped imported image is written: `preserve` (default; original JPG/JPEG, PNG, WebP or BMP bytes with the matching extension), or the opt-in WebP modes `standard` (q92), `high` (q100), and `lossless`. Auto head-crop is always a derived WebP. The `image_input.*` budget applies to every mode. Editable in Settings → Captioning & quality. |
| `image_input.max_pixels` | Largest source image any lane may decode, in pixels (default `67108864` = 64 Mi-pixels; `0` = no limit). A memory budget: ~3 bytes per decoded RGB pixel, and an edit or analysis pass can hold a second copy. Read by dataset import, ZIP/scrape ingest, Bank scan and thumbnails, edits, ComfyUI staging and Ollama vision. Bank *inference workers* keep their own fixed 16 Mi-pixel guard. Editable in Settings → Captioning & quality. |
| `image_input.max_side` | Largest side of a source image, in px (default `16384`; `0` = no limit). Separate from `max_pixels` because a wide panorama can sit inside the pixel budget and still exceed a side limit. Editable in Settings → Captioning & quality. |
| `comfyui.api_url` | Base URL of your ComfyUI instance (default `http://127.0.0.1:8188`). |
| `comfyui.base_dir` | ComfyUI install directory, used to derive `output`/`input`/`models`/`loras` dirs if those aren't set explicitly. |
| `comfyui.output_dir` | Explicit override for ComfyUI's output folder. Set it when ComfyUI runs with `--output-directory`. Editable in Settings → Local tools. |
| `comfyui.input_dir` | Explicit override for ComfyUI's input folder. Set it when ComfyUI runs with `--input-directory`. Editable in Settings → Local tools. |
| `comfyui.models_dir` | Explicit override for ComfyUI's models folder (used to scan available checkpoints/UNETs). `extra_model_paths.yaml` is still read on top of it. Editable in Settings → Local tools. |
| `comfyui.object_info_timeout_s` | Seconds ComfyUI may take to enumerate its nodes and model files (default `45`, clamped to 5-300). Raise it on an install with many custom nodes; a ComfyUI that is simply stopped is still detected in ~3 s regardless. Editable in Settings → Local tools. |
| `comfyui.loras_dir` | Explicit override for ComfyUI's LoRA folder — where trained LoRAs are installed. Wins over `extra_model_paths.yaml`; left empty, the deploy folder follows the yaml's `is_default` LoRA root, else `<install>/models/loras`. Editable in Settings → Local tools. |
| `ollama.url` | Base URL of your Ollama instance (default `http://127.0.0.1:11434`). |
| `ollama.deployment_mode` | Docker-only deployment selected in LDS Setup: `none`, `host`, or `docker`. Host and companion modes force `http://host.docker.internal:11434` and `http://ollama:11434` respectively; their URL is not user-editable. |
| `ollama.vision_model` | Ollama vision model used for auto-classify and auto head-crop (default `huihui_ai/qwen3-vl-abliterated:8b-instruct`, the uncensored **abliterated** build — use the Instruct, not Thinking, variant). |
| `ollama.vision_concurrency` | How many images a bank vision pass (watermark / framing / captions) sends to Ollama at once (default `4`, clamped to 1-16). Higher overlaps more waiting; `1` restores the old one-at-a-time behaviour. |
| `ollama.vision_keep_warm_seconds` | How long a one-off vision job (auto head-crop, Describe) may leave the model loaded when nothing else wants the GPU (default `120`, `0` = always unload, capped at 600). The lease is revoked as soon as a generation or a training starts. |
| `ollama.setup_skipped` | You chose **Continue without Ollama** in the Setup wizard (default `false`). Presentation only — it makes the Setup step read as a neutral skip instead of asking again, and gates nothing. A reachable Ollama cancels it automatically. |
| `local_llm.provider` | Which local model server serves captioning, framing, head-crop and the prompt helpers: `ollama` (default) or `lmstudio`. |
| `lmstudio.url` | LM Studio server root (default `http://127.0.0.1:1234`). A pasted `.../v1` is accepted and trimmed. |
| `lmstudio.vision_model` | Model id LDS insists on. Empty (default) = use whichever model LM Studio has loaded. |
| `lmstudio.vision_concurrency` | How many images a bank pass sends to LM Studio at once (default `4`, clamped 1-16). |
| `lmstudio.vision_keep_warm_seconds` | How long a one-off job may leave the model resident before LDS unloads it (default `120`). LM Studio has no TTL of its own, so this is what ends the residency. |
| `aitoolkit.dir` | ai-toolkit install directory. |
| `aitoolkit.datasets_dir` | Override for ai-toolkit's datasets folder (defaults to `<aitoolkit.dir>/datasets`). |
| `aitoolkit.output_dir` | Override for ai-toolkit's output folder (defaults to `<aitoolkit.dir>/output`). |
| `aitoolkit.hf_home` | Override for the Hugging Face cache directory ai-toolkit uses. |
| `aitoolkit.python` | Full path to the Python interpreter to run ai-toolkit with. Empty = auto-detect a `venv/`/`.venv/` next to `run.py`; set it for conda/uv/system-Python installs that have no venv folder. |
| `aitoolkit.url` | Web address of a running ai-toolkit UI to submit runs to, so they can be sent to one of its machines. Empty = the **Train on** picker is not offered. |
| `aitoolkit.token` | Access token for that ai-toolkit, if it runs with `AI_TOOLKIT_AUTH`. Empty = none sent. |
| `engines.default` | Image-generation engine preselected in the UI. Local-only on this fork: `klein` or `krea`. |
| `engines.enabled` | List of engines shown as options in the UI (`['klein', 'krea']` on this fork). Doubles as the engine catalogue: an engine added by an update is merged into a stored list on read, so a new engine reaches installs that already have saved settings. An engine you unticked yourself is never added back. |
| `engines.known` | Not a setting — the ledger of which engines the app was offering the last time this list was saved. Tells "this engine did not exist yet" apart from "I unticked it". Written automatically; `[]` or absent means the app assumes Klein alone. Delete it to be re-offered every engine. |
| `krea.grounding_px` | Krea 2 Edit reference grounding, `512`–`1536` (default `1024`) — the consistency vs prompt-adherence dial. |
| `krea.steps` | Krea 2 Edit sampler steps (default `8`). |
| `krea.base_model` | Krea 2 Edit base model file. Blank = auto-resolve a Turbo then Raw build. |
| `krea.identity_lora` | Krea 2 Edit identity LoRA, relative to `models/loras`. |
| `captioning.backend` | Caption backend: `auto` (prefer JoyCaption, fall back to Ollama), `joycaption`, `ollama`, or `none`. |
| `training.default_family` | Default model family preselected for new training runs (`zimage`, `sdxl`, `krea`, `flux`, `flux2klein`, or `anima`). |
| `cloud.max_concurrent_runs` | Simultaneous cloud pods allowed (default `1`, 1–10). Also in Settings → Storage. |
| `cloud.max_price_per_hour` | Safety cap on the hourly offer price in $ (default `0.80`); pricier hosts are skipped before launch. |
| `cloud.monthly_budget_usd` | Hard monthly spend ceiling in $ (default `0` = unlimited); launches are blocked past it. |
| `cloud.stall_timeout_minutes` | Kill + rescue a cloud run after this many minutes without step progress (default `30`, 5–240). |
| `cloud.first_step_timeout_minutes` | Kill a run that reaches no training step **and** reports no new downloaded bytes for this long (default `45`, 5–240). Also in Settings → Storage. |
| `cloud.first_step_download_budget_minutes` | Absolute ceiling on the pre-training base-model download, even while it is progressing (default `180`; `0` = no ceiling). Also in Settings → Storage. |
| `cloud.max_runtime_minutes` | Hard stop on the whole run (default `480`, 30–1440); the newest checkpoint is rescued first. Enforced by the out-of-run supervisor too. Also in Settings → Storage. |
| `cloud.freeze_watchdog_minutes` | Terminate a training run whose **pod** shows no progress for this long (step, download bytes or a new checkpoint), from outside the run's own supervision; the clock is durable and survives an app restart (default `45`; `0` = warn on the card only). |
| `cloud.upload_stall_minutes` | Give up a run whose dataset upload has had **no byte at all** reach the pod for this long, and release the machine (default `25`; `0` = never cut). Not a ceiling on the transfer's duration — a slow upload that keeps moving is never cut. Also in Settings → Storage. |
| `cloud.min_reliability` | vast.ai host-reliability floor (default `0.98`, 0.9–0.999); lower surfaces cheaper, riskier hosts. |
| `cloud.verified_only` | Restrict to vast.ai verified hosts (default `true`). |
| `cloud.secure_cloud_only` | Restrict to vast.ai's Secure Cloud (datacenter) tier (default `false`; narrows the market, raises price). |
| `face_scoring.python` | Python interpreter used to run the InsightFace subprocess (empty = current interpreter). |
| `face_scoring.models_root` | Directory where InsightFace model weights are stored/downloaded. |
| `face_scoring.green` | Similarity score threshold (0–1) above which an image is flagged "green" (strong match). |
| `face_scoring.orange` | Similarity score threshold (0–1) above which an image is flagged "orange" (borderline match). |
| `masks.python` | Python interpreter used to run the rembg subprocess (empty = current interpreter). |
| `wd14.python` | Python interpreter that runs the 🔖 WD14 tagger (empty = reuse `masks.python`, then the current interpreter). |
| `wd14.models_root` | Directory where the WD14 model files are stored/downloaded (empty = `data/models/wd14`). |
| `wd14.threshold` | Confidence cut for the 🔖 Tags pass, 0.05–0.95 (default `0.35`). |
| `video_caption.style` | Which PROMPT writes the captions: `standard` (default, the shipped wording) or `plain`. Measured to matter **more than the checkpoint**: asked the standard way, even an uncensored model describes *around* explicit footage, while the base model asked plainly named things precisely and wrote the best action description of the four combinations tried. `plain` adds explicit permission to state what is visible and what occurs, and forbids the two evasive words the test caught models hiding behind. It matters because a caption that talks around its subject teaches the trained model to look away, and the captions read perfectly well either way. Anything unknown falls back to `standard` — never to `plain`. Also pickable per run, next to the **🗣 Describe shots** button; every caption records the style that produced it. |
| `video_caption.model` | Which model writes the 🗣 **Describe shots** captions (empty = the shipped default, `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct`). Any checkpoint of the **same architecture** is a drop-in; a different architecture fails loudly at load rather than silently misbehaving. Worth changing when the default **talks around** what your footage shows — a caption that names things evasively teaches the trained model to do the same, and nothing in the output reveals it. Pointing this at a model the machine does not have is allowed and downloads it on the first run, but never in silence: the pass says so in its own progress line before captioning anything. Every caption records which model wrote it, so a bank captioned across a change stays readable. |
| `quantize.python` | Python interpreter that runs the **fp8 conversion** and the **LoRA→base merge** (empty = the one ✨ Score uses, then ai-toolkit's, then the app's own). Both need `torch`, which this app deliberately does **not** install — it is gigabytes and nothing else here needs it — so they run in a subprocess, like the scoring and masking passes. One setting governs both on purpose: "the Python on this machine that has torch" is one fact, and saying it twice is how the two drift apart. The chosen interpreter is probed while the *plan* is drawn: one that lacks the packages disables the button with the reason and the `pip install` line, instead of failing after the click (or after a 26 GB download). `torch` is the only module either of them needs: both read and write the safetensors format themselves rather than memory-mapping it, so an environment with torch alone is enough. |
| `bank_scoring.python` | Python interpreter that runs the ✨ Score pass (empty = the app's own). Auto-filled by Setup with a CPU-only environment; repointable at any CUDA interpreter already on the machine via the bank's **⚡ Use a GPU Python I already have** picker, which verifies every dependency first and never installs into an environment it did not create. |
| `bank_semantic.python` | Python interpreter that runs SigLIP 2. New installs record the LDS-managed Bank environment here independently of Score; repointable at any CUDA interpreter already on the machine from the Bank's **Semantic engine** panel, verified against SigLIP 2's own (shorter) dependency list and never installed into. Empty falls back to `bank_scoring.python` for older configs, then the app's own interpreter. |
| `watermark.python` | Python interpreter used to run the LaMa watermark-inpainting subprocess (empty = reuse `masks.python`, then the current interpreter). |
| `watermark.device` | LaMa processing device: `auto` (CUDA when available, otherwise CPU), `cuda`, or `cpu`. |
| `watermark.allow_crop` | When `true` (default), a border watermark is cropped off; when `false`, it is repainted instead. Also editable in the Clean bar. |
| `text_scan.score_min` | Confidence floor the 🔤 **Find text** pass keeps an OCR line at, `0`–`1`, default `0.5`. Lower catches fainter or more stylised lettering and pays for it in false zones; higher reads only what the engine is sure of. Written through from the **Sensitivity** slider in the pass's own launch window rather than from a Settings card — one stored value, read by the bank pass and the dataset pass alike, so a sensitivity judged on a sample governs the run that follows it. It does **not** move the video bank's own safe-zone measurements: those feed crop decisions and keep their own floor (`TEXT_SCORE_MIN`). |
| `zimage.vae` | Pins the Z-Image VAE (blank = the app resolves it itself, any spelling, any sub-folder). |
| `zimage.text_encoder` | Pins the Z-Image text encoder (blank = the app resolves it itself). |
| `variations.output_megapixels` | Pixel budget every generated variation is rendered at, in megapixels, on the shot card's ratio — shared by **both** local engines (Klein and Krea 2 Edit). Default `2.0` = Klein's historical hardcoded value; 0.5–2.0. Not the improve pass (`klein.improve_megapixels`), and not the ✦ reference edit (source frame, never upscaled). |
| `klein.consistency_lora` | Filename of the Klein consistency LoRA, relative to ComfyUI's LoRA folder. |
| `klein.consistency_strength` | Strength (0–1) applied to the Klein consistency LoRA. |
| `klein.generation_steps` | Sampler steps for Klein **generation** (variations, regenerate, small-image rescue). Default `5` = the value hardcoded in the shipped workflow; 1–50. Not the improve pass (`klein.improve_steps`). |
| `klein.edit_base_lora_strength` | Strength of the enhancement LoRA (`klein/realistic.safetensors`, node 139) on Klein **edits** — reference edit, variations, regenerate, small-image rescue. Default `0` = off, the render before that LoRA became a Setup download; 0–2. Not the improve pass (`klein.improve_base_lora_strength`). |
| `klein.generation_lora_presets` | Named generation-LoRA stacks (default empty) picked per run in Klein tuning; each has a name and up to 8 `{file, strength}` rows. Managed in Settings → Image engines. |
| `klein.default_generation_lora_preset` | Which of `klein.generation_lora_presets` the 🖥️ Klein tuning panel STARTS on. Default `''` = *None*, the behaviour before this key existed. A starting point only — the run panel still offers None and every other preset for that run, and picking there does not rewrite this. Fail-closed: a name matching no preset behaves as *None*. |
| `krea.default_generation_lora_preset` | The same, for `krea.generation_lora_presets` and the 🧬 Krea 2 Edit tuning panel. A SEPARATE key on purpose: the two preset lists are independent and one name can designate two different chains. Default `''`. |
| `identity_prompts.markings_lock` | Krea's “hold the skin” order — forbids inventing or redrawing marks. Blank = shipped default. Naming a body feature here summons it. |
| `identity_prompts.outfit_vary` | The outfit directive injected into every human shot with no named garment. Blank = shipped default. |
| `identity_prompts.expression_neutral` | The neutral-expression directive injected into every human shot with no named expression. Blank = shipped default. |
| `identity_prompts.outfit_palette` | Krea's concrete garments, **one per line**. Blank (or nothing but blank lines) = the shipped list. The list's LENGTH decides which shot gets which garment. |
| `identity_prompts.render_tail_sfw` / `.render_tail_nsfw` | The Klein/Krea rendering tail, SFW and uncensored. Per subject type (`by_subject.<type>.<kind>` for non-human). Blank = shipped default. |
| `identity_prompts.framing_face` / `.framing_bust` / `.framing_body` / `.framing_back` | The per-framing shot-detail block for Klein/Krea. Per subject type. Blank = shipped default. |
| `identity_prompts.by_subject.<type>.<kind>` | Identity-lock overrides for a **non-human** subject type (`animal`, `creature`, `object`, `other`) × kind (`face_single`, `face_multi`, `klein_identity`). Human overrides stay on the flat `identity_prompts.<kind>` keys. Blank/absent = the shipped default for that subject. |
| `klein.small_image_prompt` | Optional shared instruction for scraper rescue and single/bulk image improvement (empty = reference image only). |
| `updates.repo` | GitHub repo the update checker reads its release feed from (default `socrasteeze/lora-dataset-studio` — this fork's own feed). |

Additional config-file-only keys (ComfyUI folder overrides, cloud internals, quality-tool interpreters, Klein consistency LoRA) are documented in [Config-file-only settings](#config-file-only-settings) above.
