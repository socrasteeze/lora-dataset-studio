# Settings reference

Every setting in LoRA Dataset Studio, explained: what it does, its default, when to change it, and the traps to avoid.

## How settings work

Open **Settings** from the top nav. Each rail entry on the left is a section (Overview, Image engines, Scraping & sources, Local tools, Captioning & quality, Training, Server & access, Maintenance); its little LED shows live health at a glance — **green** when the section is fully configured, **amber** when it's partly set up, **off** when nothing is configured yet.

A few things hold true everywhere:

- **Nothing saves until you say so.** Change any field and a floating **Unsaved changes** bar appears with **Save** and **Discard**. Navigate away with changes pending and they're kept in the bar, not written.
- **Where values live.** Ordinary settings are written to `config.json` (git-ignored, in your data directory). Secrets — API keys and tokens — go to a separate `.env` file and are never written to `config.json` or committed.
- **Secret fields are write-only.** An API-key box is always blank, even when a key is saved (a ✓ *Configured* badge tells you it's there). Typing a new value replaces the old one; **leaving a field blank never erases a saved key** — that would be too easy to do by accident. To actually remove a key, use its **Remove** button.
- **Test buttons probe what's saved, not what's typed.** Hitting **Test** first persists whatever you've typed, then tests the *saved* setting end-to-end. So a Test result always reflects the value the app will really use.
- **Server changes need a restart.** Host, port and the access token only take effect when the server process starts. Those fields show a **Running vs Saved** comparison and a **Save & restart to apply** button. Everything else — including scraping credentials — applies immediately, no restart.
- **Search finds settings, not just sections.** The search box at the top of the page matches both section names *and* individual settings, so typing "budget" or "vision model" jumps you straight to the right field.

### Advanced: environment overrides

For containerized or scripted setups, a handful of environment variables override paths and binds before `config.json` is even read. You rarely need these — the UI covers the normal cases.

| Variable | Overrides |
|---|---|
| `LDS_DATA_DIR` | Runtime data directory (where `config.json`, datasets and trash live). |
| `LDS_CONFIG` | Path to `config.json`. |
| `LDS_ENV` | Path to the `.env` secrets file. |
| `LDS_HOST` | Bind host — takes priority over `server.host`. |
| `LDS_PORT` | Bind port — takes priority over `server.port`. |
| `LDS_NO_BROWSER` | `1` disables the browser auto-open at startup (the launcher otherwise opens the actual bound address once the server is up). |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `1` enables Flask debug mode. |

## Overview

The Overview section has **no settings of its own** — it's the at-a-glance dashboard for the rest of the page. If nothing is configured yet, it opens with a *Let's get you set up* banner. Below that, a **Capabilities** grid marks each feature ✓ or ✗ depending on what the app can currently see (a key, a reachable tool, an installed extra), and a **Where to fix it** list links straight to the section that turns each one on. Use it as your first stop to answer "why is this feature greyed out?" — then follow the link to the section that fixes it.

## Image engine

This fork generates exclusively on the local **Klein** engine (via ComfyUI) — free, private, NSFW-capable. The former cloud API engines (Nano Banana / ChatGPT) were removed; there are no engine API keys, no default/enabled-engine pickers, and no subscription login. ComfyUI itself is configured under **Local tools**; the Klein model weights install from the **Setup** page.

### Klein model files (optional)

Pin the exact files the Klein graph loads instead of relying on auto-detection. Every field accepts **a full absolute path or a ComfyUI-relative loader name**; empty fields keep the default behaviour (canonical download filename first, then a narrow token scan of the ComfyUI model folders).

- **Diffusion model (UNET)** → `klein.unet`. E.g. a full path from anywhere, or `klein/flux-2-klein-9b.safetensors` (bf16) / `klein/flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8.safetensors` under `models/unet`. This also lets you use a UNET that does **not** live in a `klein`-named subfolder (which the automatic scan would never find). The workspace's per-run Klein model picker still wins over this pin when you explicitly choose a model there. Default **empty** (auto-detect).
- **Text encoder** → `klein.text_encoder`. Full path from anywhere, or relative to `models/text_encoders` — e.g. `qwen_3_8b.safetensors` (full) or `qwen_3_8b_fp8mixed.safetensors`. Default **empty**.
- **VAE** → `klein.vae`. Full path from anywhere, or relative to `models/vae` — e.g. `flux2-vae.safetensors`. Default **empty**.
- **Consistency LoRA** → `klein.consistency_lora`. Full path from anywhere, or relative to `models/loras`. The structure-anchoring LoRA chained onto the Klein edit graph; clearing the field disables it. Default `klein/Flux2-Klein-9B-consistency-V2.safetensors` (the Setup download location).

How references resolve:

- A **full path under any of ComfyUI's model folders** — including folders registered in `extra_model_paths.yaml` (the app parses it exactly like ComfyUI does) — is converted automatically to the relative loader name ComfyUI's nodes need, and the field shows **✓ found**.
- A **full path anywhere else** (Downloads, an HF cache, another drive) is **hardlinked or symlinked** into `<ComfyUI models>/<type>/lds-pinned/` so stock loader nodes can still open it — same **✓ found** badge. The config keeps your original absolute path; the link is created on resolve.
- A reference that **can't be resolved** (missing file, or linking failed) falls back to auto-detection instead of blocking generation, with a badge so the miss is never silent.
- Native / bf16 UNETs (filename without `fp8`) run with `weight_dtype: default`; FP8 builds keep `fp8_e4m3fn`.
- Generation-LoRA **preset rows** accept full paths the same way.
- Pinning the wrong *kind* of file (e.g. another family's text encoder) is not validated — the generate will fail at sampling time with a shape error. The narrow auto-detection exists precisely to avoid that; only pin files you know are Klein-compatible.

### Klein generation LoRA presets (optional)

*Idea from @waltm on Discord.* Named combinations of generation LoRAs that stack on top of the local Klein edit graph. Stored in `klein.generation_lora_presets` (default: empty — no presets).

Each preset has a **name** and an **ordered list of LoRAs**, and each LoRA row has:

- a **file** — a name relative to your ComfyUI `models/loras` folder (e.g. `klein/my-lora.safetensors`), exactly like the consistency LoRA. The field is a **searchable dropdown of the LoRAs actually on disk** (every folder, `extra_model_paths.yaml` included), with Klein-compatible files listed first and each one badged by architecture; free text still works for a file you haven't downloaded yet;
- a **strength** — `0`–`1.5`, default **`0.6`**.

Use **＋ New preset**, **Duplicate**, **Delete** and rename to manage them, and the up/down controls to set chain order. **Caps: 8 LoRAs per preset, 12 presets.**

How presets are used matters:

- A preset is **chosen per run** in the **Klein tuning** panel of the workspace, and it **defaults to *None* every visit** — presets never apply on their own.
- Resolution happens **by name** on the server, and it's **fail-closed**: if a run references a preset name that no longer exists, it runs **with no extra LoRAs** rather than erroring.
- **Trap:** *renaming* a preset does **not** follow a run that referenced it by the old name — that run silently falls back to no extra LoRAs. Rename before you queue, or re-pick the preset on the run.
- There is deliberately **no automatic NSFW gating** on individual LoRAs — the preset you pick carries the intent. If you want an "NSFW full" stack, make it a preset.

### Identity & Klein prompts (advanced)

*Feature request by @bbsorry (雨田壹).* Every generated variation is prefixed by a hidden **identity lock** — a block of text that tells the engine to keep the subject's exact face and take the outfit and expression from the description, not the reference photo. These used to be baked in and invisible; now you can read and edit them. All are **global** (they apply to every dataset) and stored under `identity_prompts.*`.

**One box, already filled.** Each prompt is a **single editable box that already contains the exact text in use** — the built-in default when you have not overridden it. Put your cursor in it and change a word; there is no "load the default first" step, and no second read-only copy of the text below (the old two-box layout is gone).

**Nothing is stored while you match the default.** As long as the box still holds the built-in text (surrounding whitespace ignored), the setting is saved as **blank**, which is what makes *blank = use the shipped default* work. This is not cosmetic: if merely opening a prompt persisted a **copy** of it, you would be pinned to that wording forever and every later improvement to the built-in prompt would stop reaching you, silently. The line under the box always tells you which state you are in — *Following the built-in default* or *Custom override*. **Reset to default** appears only in the second case and clears the value back to blank.

**Reproducibility guarantee:** with nothing overridden, generation is **byte-identical** to before this setting existed — you only change behaviour if you deliberately edit the text away from the default.

**Shortcut from the workspace.** The multi-reference instruction is also reachable from **Add images ▸ Extra refs ▸ ✎**, without opening Settings. That modal shows **both** `identity_prompts.face_multi` and `identity_prompts.klein_identity` — the shared config carries both keys, but only `klein_identity` actually drives generation on this fork's Klein-only engine, and it's the one badged. Edits made there are the same **global** settings as here.

- **Klein — restage & face-identity block** → `identity_prompts.klein_identity`. The instruction block the local **Klein** engine uses to restage the shot (pose, framing, outfit, expression) while keeping the face identical. This is the only identity prompt shown in Settings — the `face_single`/`face_multi` keys exist in the shared config for the removed cloud engines and are not surfaced here.
- **Klein upscale & improve prompt** → `identity_prompts.klein_improve`, with an on/off toggle `identity_prompts.klein_improve_enabled` (default **on**). The fixed instruction the manual **Klein upscale & improve** action sends to add texture and detail. **Turn the toggle off** to run that action with **no prompt at all** — a pure upscale with no added styling.
- **Upscale & improve — strength** → `klein.improve_megapixels`, `klein.improve_base_lora_strength`, `klein.improve_consistency_strength`, `klein.improve_steps`. The output resolution, and how much that pass is allowed to change the image. Until these were exposed the whole profile was hardcoded — **both LoRA strengths pinned to 0**, so the *enhancement* LoRA baked into the workflow never applied at all, and the size was fixed at 2 MP whatever the source was worth. Defaults are those same historical values (**2 MP / 0 / 0 / 4 steps**), so leaving them alone keeps today's result exactly.
  - **Output size (MP)** (0.5–8, default **2**) — the source is rescaled to this pixel budget before sampling, so it *is* the result's resolution. This is the knob that makes "Upscale" actually upscale.
  - **Enhancement LoRA** (0–2, default **0**) — the workflow's own detail LoRA. At 0 it does nothing; try **0.5–0.8**. It needs its weights file (`klein/realistic.safetensors`): when that file is missing the node is skipped entirely and this value changes nothing. **Setup ▸ Install everything downloads it** with the other Klein assets (from [dx8152/Flux2-Klein-9B-Enhanced-Details](https://huggingface.co/dx8152/Flux2-Klein-9B-Enhanced-Details), Apache-2.0) — run it first if the slider seems inert.
  - **Consistency LoRA** (0–1.5, default **1**) — anchors the **composition and background**, not identity. Deliberately high here: an improve pass should add detail *without* redrawing the shot, so the resistance to editing that makes 0.8–1.0 a poor choice for restaging is exactly what you want. (Shipped briefly as `improve_character_lora_strength`, a misnomer; a value saved under that name is still honoured.)
  - **Steps** (1–50, default **4**) — more steps is slower and usually cleaner.
  - Out-of-range or malformed values are **clamped**, never rejected: a bad config weakens the pass instead of failing your click.
  - **A strength you raised is never silently dropped.** If a LoRA's weights file is missing while its strength is above 0, the pass reports the missing asset (which is what triggers its download) instead of running without it and leaving you to wonder why nothing changed. At strength 0 it stays a quiet skip — nothing is lost by not loading a LoRA you did not ask for.

Each field is a plain textarea; there's no Test button — you see the effect on your next generation. If an override ever makes results worse, hit **Restore default**.

## Scraping & sources

Credentials for the built-in web scraper. **All of these apply immediately — no restart** — because sources read their key at request time.

### Source credentials

None of these has a Test button; you find out they work on your next scan.

- **Reddit client ID** → `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` (secret). Optional. Reddit scans work out of the box using a shared public client ID, but that ID is rate-limited across everyone who uses it, so you can hit *"rate limiting requests, retry in Ns"* (429) before your first scan of the day. Your own free ID gives you a private quota and clears those. **Trap:** on reddit.com/prefs/apps, create the app as type **installed app** — a *web app* or *script* comes with a client secret, and Reddit then rejects the anonymous login this app uses (every scan fails with **401**). The field has a built-in step-by-step guide.
- **Civitai API key** → `CIVITAI_API_KEY` (secret). Optional. Without it, Civitai scans return **SFW results only**; add a key to reach adult content you're entitled to use.
- **Pexels API key (required for Pexels)** → `PEXELS_API_KEY` (secret). **Required** for any Pexels search — there's no shared fallback. The free quota is **200 requests/hour and 20,000/month**. [Create one here](https://www.pexels.com/api/key/). Note the standing warning: an API key alone does **not** authorize dataset or machine-learning use — configure this only if Pexels has explicitly authorized your use case.

### Klein rescue — small scraped images

- **Small-image rescue instruction** → `klein.small_image_prompt`. An optional free-text instruction for **one flow only**: the automatic Klein **rescue** of scraped images under 768 px. Default **empty** — and empty is intentional: with nothing here the app improves from the reference image alone rather than inventing a restoration prompt on your behalf. Unlike the identity prompts above, this field has **no built-in text behind it**, so it stays a plain empty box: there is nothing to pre-fill or reset to. Add an instruction only if you want to steer that rescue (e.g. "sharpen skin texture, keep natural tones"). The manual **"Klein upscale & improve"** action in the lightbox does **not** use this field — it has its own editable prompt under Settings ▸ Engines ▸ **Identity & Klein prompts** (`identity_prompts.klein_improve`), which can also be turned off for a pure upscale.

## Local tools

Where you point the app at the local programs that unlock the full pipeline: **ComfyUI** (Klein generation and Test Studio), **Ollama** (the vision model behind captioning and framing) and **ai-toolkit** (training and JoyCaption). Each card has a **Test** button that tells you immediately whether the app can see the tool.

### ComfyUI

- **ComfyUI API URL** → `comfyui.api_url`. The HTTP endpoint of your running ComfyUI. Default **`http://127.0.0.1:8188`**. **Test** confirms it answers.
- **ComfyUI install directory** → `comfyui.base_dir`. The folder that contains `models/`, `output/`, `input/`. Default **empty**. This is what lets the app scan your checkpoints and LoRAs — set the API URL alone and there's nothing to scan. If you point it at a `..._windows_portable` folder, the app auto-corrects to the `ComfyUI` sub-folder inside it. In the **Setup wizard** this field is checked as you type: a wrong, empty or missing folder gets a specific reason, and pointing at the launcher/parent folder offers the real ComfyUI inside it in one click.
- **Hugging Face token** → `HF_TOKEN` (secret, no Test button). Only needed to auto-download **license-gated** models — notably the Klein fp8 weights. Read access is enough for accepted gated models.

**Continuing without ComfyUI.** Leaving the install directory empty in the Setup wizard is a deliberate choice: it shows what turns off (local Klein generation including the NSFW lane, Klein watermark cleaning, the Test Studio, training on your own ComfyUI base models, and the on-disk LoRA preset picker) versus what stays on (scraping, curation, captioning, the API image engines, ai-toolkit/cloud training, Hugging Face publishing), then remembers the skip (`comfyui.setup_skipped`) so it stops nagging. Entering a directory at any point cancels the skip automatically and turns those features back on — the flag never hides a real problem with a ComfyUI you *have* configured.

**Models outside `models/`?** If your ComfyUI uses an `extra_model_paths.yaml` (portable builds and Stability Matrix installs commonly do), the app reads it the same way ComfyUI does, so bases that live elsewhere are found. This isn't a setting — it follows automatically from your install directory. Without such a file, nothing changes.

### Ollama

The card shows Ollama's live state and, when the binary is installed but the server isn't running, a **▶ Start Ollama** button that launches it for you — no terminal needed.

- **Ollama URL** → `ollama.url`. Where Ollama is listening. Default **`http://127.0.0.1:11434`**.
- **Ollama vision model** → `ollama.vision_model`. The vision model used for auto-captioning, framing auto-classify, head-crop and watermark detection. Default **`huihui_ai/qwen3-vl-abliterated:8b-instruct`** — the **abliterated** (uncensored) build, so it captions adult datasets instead of refusing them. **Trap:** keep the **`-instruct`** tag. The plain `:8b` tag is the *Thinking* variant, which reasons out loud instead of captioning and produces garbage here.

**Test** checks end-to-end: that Ollama is reachable *and* the configured model is actually pulled.

### ai-toolkit

- **ai-toolkit directory** → `aitoolkit.dir`. The folder containing ai-toolkit's `run.py`. Default **empty**. **Test** validates it and unlocks training + JoyCaption captioning.
- **Python interpreter (optional)** → `aitoolkit.python`. Default **empty = auto-detect** a `venv/` or `.venv/` next to `run.py`. Fill this with the full path to the right interpreter only if you installed ai-toolkit with **conda, uv or the system Python** (no venv folder for the app to find), e.g. `C:\miniconda3\envs\aitk\python.exe`.

Under **Advanced: ai-toolkit overrides**, three optional path overrides (all default empty → derived from the ai-toolkit directory):

- **Datasets directory override** → `aitoolkit.datasets_dir` (defaults to `<dir>/datasets`).
- **Output directory override** → `aitoolkit.output_dir` (defaults to `<dir>/output`).
- **Hugging Face cache override** → `aitoolkit.hf_home` (defaults to a cache under the ai-toolkit folder). Point this at an existing HF cache to avoid re-downloading base models.

## Captioning & quality

Settings for how captions are produced and how the quality tools behave.

### Captioning

- **Captioning backend** → `captioning.backend`. Which captioner writes your captions. Default **`auto`**.

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `auto` *(default)* | Prefer JoyCaption (via ai-toolkit), fall back to the Ollama vision model. |
| `joycaption` | JoyCaption only. |
| `ollama` | Ollama vision model only. |
| `none` | No auto-captioning — you write them yourself. |

### Watermark inpainting

- **Processing device** → `watermark.device`. Where LaMa inpainting runs. Default **`auto`**. Options: `auto` (GPU when available, otherwise CPU), `cuda` (force GPU — pauses ComfyUI while cleaning), `cpu` (keep the GPU free). This only affects the **LaMa** engine.
- **Allow automatic crop** → `watermark.allow_crop`. Default **on**. When on, a watermark sitting in an outer border band is **cropped off** (a pure pixel crop — it invents nothing). Turn it **off** and such a mark is **repainted instead** (with LaMa or Klein per the chosen engine) rather than cropped. The exact same preference is editable inline in the workspace's **Clean** bar — it's one shared value, so changing it in either place changes both.

**Honest note on engine choice.** The **LaMa (fast) vs Klein (quality)** engine is *not* a Settings toggle — it's a per-batch picker in the Clean bar and a per-image choice in the review lightbox. `watermark.device` above governs LaMa only; Klein cleaning runs through ComfyUI.

### Face similarity

Two thresholds on the 0–1 face-similarity score (InsightFace), which badge each image against your reference.

- **Face score — green threshold** → `face_scoring.green`. At or above this, the image is a **strong match** (green). Default **`0.50`**.
- **Face score — orange threshold** → `face_scoring.orange`. At or above this but below green, it's **borderline** (orange); below it, red. Default **`0.45`**.

Raise them for a stricter set, lower them if good shots are being flagged too harshly.

### Image bank triage

Thresholds for the **Bank** quality flags. Every scanned image stores its
**raw scores**, and the flags are recomputed against these values on every
read — so changing a threshold re-sorts an already-scanned bank instantly,
with **no rescan**. (The two exceptions are noted below.)

- **Sharpness minimum** → `bank.sharpness_min`. Variance of the Laplacian (the classic focus measure) under this = flagged **blurry**. Default **`100`**. Raise it to be stricter about focus, lower it if artistic soft shots get flagged.
- **Noise maximum** → `bank.noise_max`. High-frequency residual (RMS vs a Gaussian blur) over this = flagged **noisy**. Default **`15`**. Heavily textured images (foliage, fabric) score high by nature — this is a flag to review, not a verdict.
- **Uniformity minimum** → `bank.uniformity_min`. Grayscale spread under this = flagged **⬜ flat** (solid colors, black frames, empty screenshots). Default **`12`**.
- **Minimum side (px)** → `bank.min_side`. Smaller image side under this = flagged **small**. Default **`768`** — the same bar as the dataset import guard, because trainers only ever *downscale*.
- **Duplicate distance** → `bank.dup_distance`. How many of the 64 perceptual-hash bits two images may differ by and still be grouped as **≈ near-duplicates**. Default **`8`** (the same hash and distance the dataset import dedup uses). *Applies at the next quality scan* (groups are rebuilt then).
- **Same-person similarity** → `bank.face_threshold`. Cosine similarity at or above which two faces cluster as the same person in **Group by person**. Default **`0.45`**. Raise it if different people get merged into one cluster; lower it if the same person splits into several. *Applies at the next face pass* (embeddings are cached, so re-clustering is fast).
- **Aesthetic minimum** → `bank.aesthetic_min`. LAION aesthetic score (~1–10) under which an image is flagged **low aesthetic** — the "keep the nice ones" cut. Default **`5`**. Only images the **Score** pass reached carry a score; an unscored image is never flagged. The score also drives "keep best" on duplicate groups (the nicest-looking copy wins).
- **NSFW maximum** → `bank.nsfw_max`. NSFW probability (0–1) over which an image is flagged **🔞 NSFW**, to split a mixed SFW/NSFW dump. Default **`0.5`**. Set by the **Score** pass; a review flag, not a verdict.
- **Same-style similarity** → `bank.style_threshold`. Cosine similarity on the CLIP image embeddings at or above which two images share a visual **style** (screenshots/memes cluster apart from photoreal) in the **Score** pass. Default **`0.6`**. *Applies at the next scoring pass* (embeddings are cached, so re-clustering at another threshold is fast).
- **Semantic duplicate similarity** → `bank.semantic_dup_threshold`. Cosine similarity on the *same* CLIP embeddings at or above which two scored images are grouped as a **semantic near-duplicate** — a crop or re-compressed variant of the *same shot* that the perceptual-hash **Duplicates** (stage 1) misses. Default **`0.96`** (much higher than the style threshold: a crop is far closer than merely "same style"). Needs the **Score** pass first (it reuses those embeddings — no extra GPU work). *Re-running at another threshold re-sorts instantly* from the cached embeddings, no re-scan.

The **Score** pass (aesthetic · NSFW · style) needs the **Bank scoring** extra (Setup ▸ Quality tools); **Find watermarks** reuses the vision model from **Captioning**. Both are GPU passes, serialized against training and captioning, and detection-only — the bank never edits your source files.

## Training

Defaults for new local training runs.

### Defaults

- **Default training family** → `training.default_family`. The model family preselected when you start a new run. One of `zimage`, `sdxl`, `krea`, `flux`, `flux2klein`. Default **`zimage`**. Purely a starting point — you can switch family per run.

This fork's Settings → Training keeps only **Defaults** — there is no rental-GPU card here (no key field, no cost/budget knobs). Cloud training (vast.ai) still runs underneath for any dataset that already has a cloud run in its history — see **Cloud training (vast.ai)** under [Config-file-only settings](#config-file-only-settings) for the `VAST_API_KEY` secret and the `cloud.*` guard-rails, all of which are edited by hand in `config.json`/`.env` rather than through a Settings card.

### Advanced options (per run)

These live under **Advanced options** in a dataset's training panel — rank, resolution, save/sample cadence, optimizer, scheduler, EMA, LoKr and more. Each carries its own inline **Why/How** note, so they aren't repeated here. One is worth calling out because of a caveat:

- **Dual captions (long + short)** — off by default. When on, the run uses ai-toolkit's native `short_and_long_captions`: every image trains with **both** its full caption and a short one (text-side augmentation, so the LoRA leans less on any single wording). The short variant is **derived from the long caption** the next time you (re-)caption — text-only, via the local vision model, honouring the same kind rules (no trigger; the identity/concept/aesthetic stays omitted) — and you can edit it per image in the **⛶** caption editor.

## Server & access

How the app binds and who can reach it. **These are the settings that need a restart** — the card shows a **Running vs Saved** banner and a **Save & restart to apply** button that does it in one click.

- **Port** → `server.port`. The port the app listens on. Default **`5050`**. Change it if something else owns the port (on macOS, port 5000 is taken by AirPlay Receiver).
- **Available on the local network** — a toggle that flips the bind host between `127.0.0.1` (this machine only, the default) and `0.0.0.0` (reachable from your LAN — phone, tablet, another PC). The token and phone controls below only appear once this is on.
- **Require an access token** → `server.require_token`. Default **off** — a home LAN is treated as trusted, so LAN access is open and there's no token to type on a phone. Turn it **on** to demand a token from remote devices; requests from localhost never need one.
- **Access token** → `server.access_token`. Shown only when the token gate is on: a read-only field with **Generate new token** and **Copy**. It's persisted, so it survives restarts. Open `http://<machine>:<port>/?token=<token>` once from the remote device and a signed session cookie takes over.
- **Open it on your phone** — a card with a scannable **QR code** and copyable URLs built from this machine's real LAN IP (and Tailscale IP, if present). No guessing which address to type.

**Trap:** if you launched via `start.bat` with `LDS_PORT` set, that variable can override the port in your config. The in-app **Save & restart** pins host and port for the relaunch, precisely so the restart lands on the port you chose rather than the one the script forced.

## Maintenance

Housekeeping and diagnostics. Only one true setting lives here; the rest are actions.

- **Updates** — **Check for updates** and **Update & restart**, plus a *see what's in this update* compare link. **The button adapts to how you installed.** A **git checkout** fast-forwards to the latest commits. A **packaged (ZIP) install** announces the release and its size (*Update to vX — download ~XX MB*) and shows a **live progress bar** while it downloads and installs (a release ZIP is far larger than a git pull), then backs up the current files and swaps in the new ones — keeping `data/`, `config.json`, `.env` and your `.venv` untouched — and restarts. A mid-way failure rolls back automatically, so a broken download never leaves you with a half-updated install. If the app can't identify a downloadable release (no ZIP asset, or offline), the button steps aside and links to the releases page instead of promising an update it can't perform.
- **Trash** — **Open folder** and **Empty trash**. Everything the app deletes goes here first; emptying is the one destructive action, and it asks for confirmation.
- **Back up everything** — not on this page but on the **Datasets library**: one button archives every dataset, its **training history** and your settings into a single file (download or open folder), and the library's **Import backup** restores it — datasets come back under **Trained**, not "Not trained yet". Tick **Include trained LoRAs** to bundle the (large) trained `.safetensors` too. **API keys and tokens are never included** — re-enter them on the new install. See *Using the app → Back up everything*.
- **Dataset images root** → `paths.dataset_images_root`. Where dataset images are stored. Default **empty → `<data dir>/datasets`**. Point it at a bigger or faster drive if your default data directory is tight on space.
- **Diagnostic report** — a one-click, **paste-safe** report for bug reports: it carries the version, capability status and a log tail, with **no secrets** and file paths reduced to booleans (present/absent). Safe to drop into Discord or a GitHub issue.
- **Server log** — a live tail of the server log, with **Copy all**, for when you need to see what just happened.

## Per-dataset settings

Separate from everything above: these live **per dataset**, in the **Dataset settings** modal you open from the workspace. They travel with that one dataset and don't touch the global Settings page.

- **Name** — the dataset's display name. **Display only** for Character and Concept datasets: it never appears in a file name, so changing it touches nothing on disk (the *trigger word* names produced files — see below). **On a Style dataset it means more**: a Style is always-on and has no visible trigger, so its name is its only editable identity — renaming it also renames the LoRAs, run folder and export it already produced (and is refused while a run is live, same as a trigger change).
- **Dataset kind** *(🧑 Character / 💡 Concept / 🎨 Style)* — the nature of the LoRA, chosen at creation but changeable here. It is the disruptive setting, so picking a different pill reveals a confirmation block that spells out **what changes** and **what is kept** before you save:
  - *What changes* — the **caption strategy** (Character leaves out identity; Concept leaves out the recurring concept; Style leaves out the aesthetic), which **panels show** (Reference photo, Generate variations and Face analysis are Character-only — they appear when you become a Character and are hidden otherwise), the **trigger's role** (Style has none; switching to Character/Concept brings the field back, prefilled), and Character-only settings such as **face/body fidelity**. Switching **to Concept** requires a concept description.
  - *What is kept* — **nothing is deleted.** Every image, its caption text, keep/reject status, face scores, watermark work and **training history** stay exactly as they are (past runs are named by the model family and trigger, never the kind). A concept description is remembered so switching back restores it.
  - Existing captions were written for the **old** kind and are **not** rewritten automatically — use **🔄 Re-caption** in the Captions section to apply the new strategy. The switch is refused while the dataset has work in progress (generation, captioning or a quality pass) — wait for it to finish.
- **Trigger word** — the word you put in prompts to summon this LoRA (Character and Concept datasets). Safe to change anytime — it's added at export, so existing captions don't need redoing. It is also **the name everything this dataset produces carries** (the deployed LoRA, the training run folder, the export, the job config), so changing it **renames all of them to match** and repoints the Test Studio history and cloud runs at the new names — a toast tells you how many files moved. Two guards: if the new trigger is already used on disk by another dataset, **nothing** is renamed (never half a set) and the old names are kept; and the change is **refused while a training run is live**, because that run folder is what training resumes from — stop it or let it finish first. **Style datasets don't have one**: Style is always-on, and the modal shows a note reminding you to control the effect with the LoRA weight instead.
- **Concept description** *(Concept datasets only)* — the thing the LoRA learns, i.e. exactly what captions must **omit**. Editing it rebuilds the caption avoid-list, so **re-caption** afterwards to apply the new list to images already captioned.
- **Prompt suffixes** *(collapsible — optional creative direction)* — free text appended to **generated** variations at generation time, to steer a global look without rewriting anything:
  - **All shots** → `prompt_suffix` — one global suffix (e.g. *"shot on 35mm film, warm tones"*), up to **300 characters**.
  - **Face / Bust / Body / Back shots** → `prompt_suffixes` — one suffix per framing, up to **300 characters** each. A framing suffix applies to that shot type first, then the global one.

  Key behaviours: these are **applied at generation time and never stored into a tile's own prompt** (so a regenerate can't double-apply them), the **identity lock always comes first** — a suffix can't override it, clearing a field removes that suffix, and existing images stay as they are until you **regenerate** to apply.

  You can also edit the very same suffixes **inline in the generation panel** (the collapsible *Prompt suffixes* row under the shot picker), which is handy for tuning them **per batch** without opening this modal — both surfaces read and write the one dataset value, and an edit made there is saved the moment you press **Generate**.

## Config-file-only settings

These have no UI control — they're for advanced users editing `config.json` by hand (copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` first). Most people never touch them; the defaults are tuned. Values below are the shipped defaults.

**ComfyUI folder overrides** — explicit paths that override the folders otherwise derived from `comfyui.base_dir`:

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `comfyui.output_dir` | `''` | Override ComfyUI's output folder. |
| `comfyui.input_dir` | `''` | Override ComfyUI's input folder. |
| `comfyui.models_dir` | `''` | Override the models folder scanned for checkpoints/UNETs. |
| `comfyui.loras_dir` | `''` | Override the LoRA folder. |

**Quality-tool interpreters and models:**

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `face_scoring.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the InsightFace subprocess (empty = current interpreter). |
| `face_scoring.models_root` | `''` | Where InsightFace weights are stored/downloaded. |
| `face_scoring.device` | `'auto'` | Device for the Image-bank face pass. `auto` uses the GPU when the face interpreter exposes CUDA (needs `onnxruntime-gpu` installed in it) and falls back to CPU otherwise; `cpu` forces CPU (never touches the GPU); `cuda` requests the GPU but still falls back to CPU when unavailable. A GPU run is serialized through the GPU-exclusive window so it never competes with a training/scoring pass. |
| `bank_scoring.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the Image-bank Score pass (aesthetic / NSFW / style). Empty = current interpreter until Setup installs the managed `data/envs/bank_scoring` venv and records its path here. |
| `bank_scoring.models_root` | `''` | Optional cache root for Score-pass model weights. |
| `masks.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the rembg (person-mask) subprocess. |
| `watermark.python` | `''` | Interpreter for the LaMa watermark subprocess. **Auto-managed:** leave it empty and the **Install inpainting** button builds a dedicated Python 3.10-3.12 environment for you (`simple-lama-inpainting` needs Pillow&lt;10, so it can't share the app's own Python) and fills this in automatically. Set it yourself only to point at an environment you already have — a manual value is always respected and never overwritten. |

**Klein consistency LoRA:**

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `klein.consistency_lora` | `klein/Flux2-Klein-9B-consistency-V2.safetensors` | The structure-anchoring LoRA on the Klein edit graph, relative to ComfyUI's LoRA folder. |
| `klein.consistency_strength` | `0.5` | Its strength (0–1). Its own guide warns 0.8–1.0 can stop edits applying; `0` disables it entirely. |

**Updates:**

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `updates.repo` | `perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio` | The GitHub repo the update checker reads its release feed from. |

**Cloud training (vast.ai):** this fork's Settings → Training has no rental-GPU card, so these are edited by hand. Cloud training itself still works end to end (a dataset with an existing cloud run keeps showing it in **Runs**, and Continue/Retry still work) — there's simply no guided Settings UI to launch a *new* one.

| Key | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `VAST_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Secret, in `.env`. Required to enable cloud training at all. |
| `cloud.max_concurrent_runs` | `1` | Simultaneous cloud pods allowed (1–10). |
| `cloud.max_price_per_hour` | `0.80` | Safety cap on the hourly offer price in $; pricier hosts are skipped before launch. |
| `cloud.monthly_budget_usd` | `0` | Hard monthly spend ceiling in $ (`0` = unlimited); launches are blocked past it. |
| `cloud.stall_timeout_minutes` | `30` | Kill + rescue a cloud run after this many minutes without step progress. |
| `cloud.unreachable_grace_minutes` | `6` | How long a running pod may stay unreachable (a vast.ai network blackout, measured as real consecutive silence) before the run is given up and auto-retried on a fresh host. Raise it if healthy runs die with *pod unreachable*. |
| `cloud.min_reliability` | `0.98` | vast.ai host-reliability floor (0.9–0.999); lower surfaces cheaper, riskier hosts. |
| `cloud.verified_only` | `true` | Restrict to vast.ai verified hosts. |
| `cloud.secure_cloud_only` | `false` | Restrict to vast.ai's Secure Cloud (datacenter) tier (narrows the market, raises price). |

## config.json key reference (all keys)

A flat cheat-sheet of the main `config.json` keys, for quick lookup or hand-editing (copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` first — it's git-ignored, in your data directory). Every key here is documented in full, with defaults and traps, in the sections above; this table is the index. **Secrets** (`HF_TOKEN`, `VAST_API_KEY`, optional scraper credentials) live in `.env`, not here. This fork has no `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` — the cloud image-generation engines were removed; Klein/ComfyUI is the only generation path.
