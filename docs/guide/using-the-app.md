# Using the app

The workspace is a **guided flow**: each stage stays folded until the one
before it is done, and the progress rail on the left tells you where you are
and what's blocking the next step. You never have to guess what comes next —
this chapter just explains what each stage does and where the useful buttons
hide.

## The character walkthrough (reference photo → trained LoRA)

1. **Create the dataset** — Datasets → New. Pick **Character**, name it, set a
   **trigger word** (the token your prompts will use), and choose the **target
   model** (Z-Image / SDXL / Krea 2 / FLUX.1 / FLUX.2 Klein — changes the caption
   style; you can change it later).
2. **Upload the reference photo.** The app head-crops it automatically; use the
   crop editor (or *Reset to auto*) if the framing is off. Up to 3 extra angles
   can be added for multi-view consistency.
3. **Generate variations** — fire the **variation catalog** on the local Klein
   engine: 45 shots across expression,
   angle, lighting, framing, outfit and background, each wrapped in an identity
   guard so the face stays the same person.
4. **Import** your own photos too (drag & drop) — each is auto-cropped to the
   face on the way in.
5. **Auto-classify framing.** A local vision model tags every image
   **face / bust / body / back**; the badges feed the composition meter.
6. **Curate** — keep / reject / crop, guided by the live meter targeting
   **12 face · 6 bust · 6 body · 1 back**. Watch the face-similarity badges
   (green = strong match, orange = review) to drop off-identity shots before
   they poison training.
7. **Caption** — one click captions the kept set (prose or booru tags,
   matched to the target model). The **identity-leak check** flags any caption
   that describes hair/face/skin — fix every flagged one. A find/replace +
   tag-frequency panel sweeps the whole set at once; its **Write .txt
   files** button drops a kohya-style `<image>.txt` next to each kept image
   in the dataset folder (same format as the export ZIP) for external tools.
8. **Fix individual shots** — every generated tile has a ✏ button: edit the
   exact prompt that made it and regenerate in place, without losing the rest.
9. **Train** — the pre-flight check runs the full checklist (count, balance,
   captions, leaks, duplicates). It no longer *blocks*: leaking captions and
   near-duplicates are editable right inside the confirm, and missing captions
   just ask you to **Start anyway** (captions stay strongly recommended). Steps
   are computed automatically; Advanced options exposes every knob (each with
   its own why/how) and a **Presets** row — apply a shipped ★ recipe (*Krea
   character*, *Concept*, *Style*) or save/import/export your own as a JSON.
   No GPU? **Train in cloud** rents one per run. Watch this run — and every
   other, cloud or local — from the **Runs** tab, where you can retry a
   failed run (↻), continue a finished cloud run for more steps (▶), and download
   the LoRA.
10. **Pick the best checkpoint** — open the **Test Studio** from the dataset:
    grid-test checkpoint × strength, vote, rank by face similarity, and star ★
    the winning settings. The last checkpoint is almost never the best one.
11. **Export** — at any point, **Export ZIP** gives you the curated, captioned
    set as a standard ai-toolkit dataset. Nothing is locked in.

## Concept datasets (an object or action, not a person)

Pick **Concept** at creation and describe the concept in the required field —
the captioner needs to know exactly *what to omit*. What changes vs character:

- **No reference photo.** Images come from **import** or the built-in
  **scraper** (paste a gallery URL or run a Reddit keyword search, tick the
  frames you want, they land straight in the dataset — deduplicated and
  quality-filtered). Already have a kohya-style dataset on disk (images +
  same-name `.txt` captions)? **⋯ More → Import from folder…** merges it in
  from a pasted folder path — captions attach, duplicates are skipped (a ZIP
  works too, via **Import dataset**). On gallery sites (PornPics), a category/tag/search scan
  shows **the same previews the listing page does** — one per gallery, the shot
  that actually matches your keyword. Tick **Scan full albums** to pull every
  photo of each matched gallery instead, or paste a single `/galleries/…` URL
  to get that whole album. Sex.com works the same way for keyword searches
  (`sex.com/en/pics?search=…`) — every pin **is** a single matching image, so
  there is no album option to worry about. Civitai searches return **SFW
  results only** unless you add a Civitai API key in **Settings → Scraping &
  sources**.

  > **Reddit says "wait N seconds" (429)?** By default Reddit scans share a
  > public client id (and its ~1000 requests / 10 min quota) with many other
  > people, so it can be exhausted before your first scan. Add your own free
  > client ID in **Settings → Scraping & sources** — a one-minute, step-by-step
  > guide is built into that page.
- **Captions invert**: they describe everything *except* the concept, so the
  concept is what binds to the trigger. The leak check watches for stray
  descriptions of it.
- **Masked training is off** (a person mask would erase the very thing you're
  teaching), and imports keep the full frame instead of head-cropping.

## Style datasets (a global aesthetic)

Pick **Style** at creation. What changes:

- **No trigger word** — the style tints every image once the LoRA is loaded.
- **Captions describe content only** (never the rendering), and they're
  optional; caption dropout rises so the style generalizes.
- **Step count switches to a sublinear √n scale** built for the large sets
  (hundreds of images) style LoRAs want.

## Back up everything

The **Back up everything** button on the Datasets library packs your whole
setup into a single file so you can move to a new machine — or recover from one
— without losing anything.

- **What's inside**: every dataset (all images, captions, statuses, face and
  watermark states, references), its **training history** (which runs produced
  which version, the settings each used), plus your **settings** — engine
  choices, training defaults, cloud tuning, watermark preferences. It's a
  *logical* backup, one entry per dataset, not a raw disk dump.
- **Include trained LoRAs** (checkbox next to the button): also bundle the
  trained `.safetensors` files themselves. These are large — hundreds of MB per
  checkpoint — so it's **off by default**; the light training history above is
  always included, so a dataset comes back under **Trained** either way. Tick it
  when you want the finished LoRAs to travel too.
- **What's never inside**: your **API keys, Hugging Face token and scraping
  credentials**. They are deliberately left out so the file is safe to copy
  around; re-enter them once on the new install.
- **How it runs**: in the background. A library can be gigabytes, so you get a
  live "X / N datasets" progress bar and can keep working. When it's done, use
  **Download** to save the archive, or **Open folder** to find it on disk.
- **Restoring**: hand the master archive to the same **Import backup** button.
  It restores your settings (without overwriting keys you've already entered),
  rebuilds each dataset **and its training history** — so it lands back under
  **Trained** instead of "Not trained yet", with its runs in the Runs hub.
  Bundled LoRA files are re-deployed to ComfyUI when it's configured on the new
  machine; if it isn't, they're reported as skipped and the **Trained** status
  still stands (the run is what marks it trained, not the file on disk). Nothing
  is ever overwritten — a dataset whose name already exists comes back with a
  `(restored)` suffix — and you get an honest final report of what was restored,
  renamed or skipped.

## The image bank (triage a big folder)

You exported 9 000 unsorted images from Telegram (or a scraper dumped a
mountain of files) and a dataset only needs the best 30–150 of them. The
**Bank** tab is the triage funnel that gets you there — without ever
touching the folder itself:

1. **Create a bank** — give it a name and paste the folder path. The app
   inventories every image in place (subfolders included). Nothing is copied,
   nothing is modified; rejecting an image is a reversible status, never a file
   deletion.
2. **Scan quality** — a background pass (CPU only, a few minutes even on
   thousands of images) scores every file: sharpness, noise, flat/empty
   frames, resolution — and groups **near-duplicates**. The flags follow the
   thresholds in *Settings → Captioning & quality*; because the raw scores are
   stored, tuning a threshold re-sorts the bank instantly, no rescan.
3. **Cull** — use the filter chips (Blurry, Noisy, ⬜ Flat, Small,
   ≈ Duplicates) to review the worst offenders first. **Auto-reject
   flagged…** clears whole categories in one click (your manual ✓/✕ are never
   flipped). In the Duplicates view, resolve every group at once with **keep
   best** (highest resolution, then sharpest) or **keep first**, or pick the
   keeper by eye.
4. **Group by person** — the face pass (needs the Quality tools from Setup)
   detects the dominant face of every remaining image and clusters the bank by
   person, *no reference photo needed*. Click a person card to see only them,
   select all, keep or reject. Embeddings are cached, so re-running after a
   cull is much faster.
5. **Promote** — the kept images are **copied** into the dataset you choose
   through the normal import path: normalized to webp, near-duplicates already
   in the dataset skipped. From there they get everything datasets have —
   captions, watermark cleaning, face scoring against a reference, training.

Work the funnel in that order: quality first (cheap, catches the trash), then
subject, then selection. A promoted image keeps its badge in the bank so you
always know what's been used where.

## Tips that save runs

- Trust the composition meter over your instinct — a set that "looks varied"
  is usually still face-heavy.
- Fix every leak the badge reports before training; one "a woman with long
  blonde hair" caption quietly competes with your trigger.
- Don't chase steps. Train the auto count, then let the Test Studio find the
  *earliest* checkpoint that nails the identity — it keeps the most prompt
  flexibility.
- The next chapter — **Building a good dataset** — explains *why* behind every
  rule above. Read it once before your first serious run.
