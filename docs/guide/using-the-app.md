# Using the app

The workspace is a **guided flow**: each stage stays folded until the one
before it is done, and the progress rail on the left tells you where you are
and what's blocking the next step. You never have to guess what comes next —
this chapter just explains what each stage does and where the useful buttons
hide.

The walkthrough below follows a **character** dataset end to end because it
exercises the most stages; **concept**, **style** and the **image bank** each
get their own section after it. The flow is the same for all of them — only the
captioning rules and a few guards change with the dataset kind.

---

## The character walkthrough (reference photo → trained LoRA)

1. **Create the dataset** — Datasets → New. Pick **Character**, name it, set a
   **trigger word** (the token your prompts will use), and choose the **target
   model** (Z-Image / SDXL / Krea 2 / FLUX.1 / FLUX.2 Klein — changes the caption
   style; you can change it later).
2. **Upload the reference photo.** The app head-crops it automatically; use the
   crop editor (or *Reset to auto*) if the framing is off. Up to 3 extra angles
   can be added for multi-view consistency.
3. **Generate variations** — fire the **variation catalog** on the local Klein
   engine: 53 shots across expression,
   angle, lighting, framing, outfit and background, each wrapped in an identity
   guard so the face stays the same person.
4. **Import** your own photos too (drag & drop) — each is auto-cropped to the
   face on the way in.
5. **Auto-classify framing.** A local vision model tags every image
   **face / bust / body / back**; the badges feed the composition meter.
6. **Curate** — keep / reject / crop, guided by the live meter targeting
   **12 face · 6 bust · 6 body · 1 back**. Watch the face-similarity badges
   (green = strong match, orange = review) to drop off-identity shots before
   they poison training.
7. **Caption** — one click captions the kept set (prose or booru tags,
   matched to the target model). The **identity-leak check** flags any caption
   that describes hair/face/skin — fix every flagged one. A find/replace +
   tag-frequency panel sweeps the whole set at once; its **Write .txt
   files** button drops a kohya-style `<image>.txt` next to each kept image
   in the dataset folder (same format as the export ZIP) for external tools.
8. **Fix individual shots** — every generated tile has a ✏ button: edit the
   exact prompt that made it and regenerate in place, without losing the rest.
9. **Train** — the pre-flight check runs the full checklist (count, balance,
   captions, leaks, duplicates). It no longer *blocks*: leaking captions and
   near-duplicates are editable right inside the confirm, and missing captions
   just ask you to **Start anyway** (captions stay strongly recommended). Steps
   are computed automatically; Advanced options exposes every knob (each with
   its own why/how) and a **Presets** row — apply a shipped ★ recipe (*Krea
   character*, *Concept*, *Style*) or save/import/export your own as a JSON.
   Training runs on your local GPU via ai-toolkit. Watch this run — and every
   other — from the **Runs** tab, where you can retry a failed run (↻),
   continue a finished run for more steps (▶), and download the LoRA.
10. **Pick the best checkpoint** — open the **Test Studio** from the dataset:
    grid-test checkpoint × strength, vote, rank by face similarity, and star ★
    the winning settings. The last checkpoint is almost never the best one.
11. **Export** — at any point, **Export ZIP** gives you the curated, captioned
    set as a standard ai-toolkit dataset. Nothing is locked in.

## Concept datasets (an object or action, not a person)

Pick **Concept** at creation and describe the concept in the required field —
the captioner needs to know exactly *what to omit*. What changes vs character:

- **No reference photo.** Images come from **import** or the built-in
  **scraper** (paste a gallery URL or run a Reddit keyword search, tick the
  frames you want, they land straight in the dataset — deduplicated and
  quality-filtered). Already have a kohya-style dataset on disk (images +
  same-name `.txt` captions)? **⋯ More → Import from folder…** merges it in
  from a pasted folder path — captions attach, duplicates are skipped (a ZIP
  works too, via **Import dataset**). On gallery sites (PornPics), a category/tag/search scan
  shows **the same previews the listing page does** — one per gallery, the shot
  that actually matches your keyword. Tick **Scan full albums** to pull every
  photo of each matched gallery instead, or paste a single `/galleries/…` URL
  to get that whole album. Sex.com works the same way for keyword searches
  (`sex.com/en/pics?search=…`) — every pin **is** a single matching image, so
  there is no album option to worry about. Civitai searches return **SFW
  results only** unless you add a Civitai API key in **Settings → Scraping &
  sources**.

  > **Reddit says "wait N seconds" (429)?** By default Reddit scans share a
  > public client id (and its ~1000 requests / 10 min quota) with many other
  > people, so it can be exhausted before your first scan. Add your own free
  > client ID in **Settings → Scraping & sources** — a one-minute, step-by-step
  > guide is built into that page.
- **Captions invert**: they describe everything *except* the concept, so the
  concept is what binds to the trigger. The leak check watches for stray
  descriptions of it.
- **Masked training is off** (a person mask would erase the very thing you're
  teaching), and imports keep the full frame instead of head-cropping.

## Style datasets (a global aesthetic)

Pick **Style** at creation. What changes:

- **No trigger word** — the style tints every image once the LoRA is loaded.
- **Captions describe content only** (never the rendering), and they're
  optional; caption dropout rises so the style generalizes.
- **Step count switches to a sublinear √n scale** built for the large sets
  (hundreds of images) style LoRAs want.

## Krea and the shape of your reference photo

**Krea 2 Edit reproduces the shape of your reference photo** (capped at 2 MP).
That is not a setting — the identity-edit LoRA was trained on same-size pairs,
so an output whose aspect ratio differs from the source loses likeness. Krea
therefore ignores each shot's own aspect hint. **Klein and the API engines do
not work this way**: they follow the shot.

What this means in practice, measured on the same shot with the same seed:

| Reference | Result for `body_stand_front` |
| --- | --- |
| Square, 1024×1024 | Framed around the **bust** — the model moves in |
| Portrait, 835×1024 | **Full figure**, down to the calves |

Nothing is broken and no prompt fixes it: a standing figure does not fit in a
square, so the model resolves the conflict by cropping tighter. Since the human
catalog is mostly `body` shots, a square reference quietly squeezes almost
everything a character dataset wants.

**The fix is one crop.** When you tick Krea with a square or landscape reference
and wide shots selected, the generation panel says how many shots are affected
and offers **✂ Crop reference to 3:4** — the same crop editor as the ✂ button on
the reference, opened on the full-frame original with the 3:4 ratio pre-set. You
can still reshape the box, or pick 2:3 / 9:16 for even more room.

Two things worth knowing:

- **✂ Auto head-crop** (the checkbox next to the reference) and **↺ Reset to
  auto** inside the crop editor both produce a **square**. They are built for
  face likeness, not for full-body framing — do not use them to answer this
  notice.
- The notice only appears for Krea, only when the reference can be measured, and
  only when body/back shots are actually selected. A face-only run never sees it.

## Your own shot catalog (JSON import)

The workspace ships a built-in shot catalog per subject type (53 shots for a
human, ~59 for an animal, 55 for an anime character, and so on). If you want shots nobody wrote for you —
40 breed-specific poses for a dog, a product line's signature angles — you don't
have to type them one at a time. Open **📥 Shot catalog (JSON)** under the shot
grid.

**Export first.** The exported file is the format, and the example an LLM needs:

```json
{
  "format": "lds-shots/1",
  "subject_type": "animal",
  "shots": [
    {
      "label": "Dog, zoomies on the lawn",
      "framing": "body",
      "prompt": "full body photo of the animal running fast across a lawn, side view, sunny day"
    }
  ],
  "examples": []
}
```

Then ask a chat assistant for more shots *in that exact shape*, and import the
file it gives you.

Each shot needs three things:

- **`label`** — a short name, max 80 characters, shown on the card. It must be
  unique: not a built-in label (of *any* subject type), and not one of your
  existing shots. The app refuses a collision and tells you which label is at
  fault — two shots sharing a label would make it resolve the wrong prompt the
  day you regenerate one.
- **`framing`** — exactly one of `face`, `bust`, `body`, `back`. Anything else is
  refused; it is never quietly remapped.
- **`prompt`** — the text sent to the image engine, max 500 characters.

`nsfw: true` is optional and only has an effect when Klein is the only engine
checked. Everything under **`examples`** is ignored on import — that's how the
export can show you samples without them coming back as duplicates. Any other
field (including `aspect`) is ignored too, and the import summary says so: an
imported shot uses its framing's default aspect ratio.

**Nothing is written until you confirm.** The app reads the file, lists what
would land and what it refuses (naming the entry and the reason), and waits. A
40-shot file whose 37th entry is broken never leaves 36 shots half-imported.

Imported shots appear in their own **📥 Imported** group after the built-ins, one
set per subject type. They never replace a built-in, you can delete them one by
one or all at once, and they're stored with the app — not in the browser — so
they survive a cache wipe, show up on your phone and ride along in the backup.

### Keeping a shot you wrote by hand

The **✨ Custom shot** box below the grid is the quick way to add one shot: type a
prompt, pick a framing, Add. Those cards are stored **in your browser**, so
clearing its data takes them with it.

Any card you want to keep, press **Keep** on it. It moves into the 📥 Imported
group and is saved with the app, exactly like an imported shot — surviving a
cache wipe, following you to another device, included in the backup. The card
keeps its identity, so a shot preset that had it selected still works. If its
label happens to clash with a built-in shot or with one you already imported, the
app says which label and refuses rather than creating a duplicate; rename the
card (remove it and add it again) and press **Keep** once more.

## Back up everything

The **Back up everything** button on the Datasets library packs your whole
setup into a single file so you can move to a new machine — or recover from one
— without losing anything.

- **What's inside**: every dataset (all images, captions, statuses, face and
  watermark states, references), its **training history** (which runs produced
  which version, the settings each used), plus your **settings** — engine
  choices, training defaults, cloud tuning, watermark preferences. It's a
  *logical* backup, one entry per dataset, not a raw disk dump.
- **Include trained LoRAs** (checkbox next to the button): also bundle the
  trained `.safetensors` files themselves. These are large — hundreds of MB per
  checkpoint — so it's **off by default**; the light training history above is
  always included, so a dataset comes back under **Trained** either way. Tick it
  when you want the finished LoRAs to travel too.
- **What's never inside**: your **API keys, Hugging Face token and scraping
  credentials**. They are deliberately left out so the file is safe to copy
  around; re-enter them once on the new install.
- **How it runs**: in the background. A library can be gigabytes, so you get a
  live "X / N datasets" progress bar and can keep working. When it's done, use
  **Download** to save the archive, or **Open folder** to find it on disk.
- **Restoring**: hand the master archive to the same **Import backup** button.
  It restores your settings (without overwriting keys you've already entered),
  rebuilds each dataset **and its training history** — so it lands back under
  **Trained** instead of "Not trained yet", with its runs in the Runs hub.
  Bundled LoRA files are re-deployed to ComfyUI when it's configured on the new
  machine; if it isn't, they're reported as skipped and the **Trained** status
  still stands (the run is what marks it trained, not the file on disk). Nothing
  is ever overwritten — a dataset whose name already exists comes back with a
  `(restored)` suffix — and you get an honest final report of what was restored,
  renamed or skipped.

## The image bank (triage a big folder)

You exported 9 000 unsorted images from Telegram (or a scraper dumped a
mountain of files) and a dataset only needs the best 30–150 of them. The
**Bank** tab is the triage funnel that gets you there — without ever
touching the folder itself:

1. **Create a bank** — give it a name and paste the folder path. The app
   inventories every image in place (subfolders included). Nothing is copied,
   nothing is modified; rejecting an image is a reversible status, never a file
   deletion. If your folder is really a *folder of folders* (a Telegram export
   with one subfolder per chat, say), tick **One bank per subfolder** and each
   top-level subfolder becomes its own bank — so you can curate, queue and
   promote each one separately. A preview shows exactly which banks will be made
   and how many images each holds; loose images sitting directly in the parent
   get their own bank too, so nothing is dropped. The folder also stays LIVE:
   keep dropping images into it and they are picked up automatically the next
   time you open the bank list or the bank itself ("42 new image(s) found in the
   folder"), as undecided images ready for the next scan — your existing
   keep/reject decisions, scores and captions are never touched. Files you
   removed from the folder are reported at the top of the bank, never deleted
   from it, so an unplugged drive can't wipe your triage.
2. **Scan quality** — a background pass (CPU only, a few minutes even on
   thousands of images) scores every file: sharpness, noise, flat/empty
   frames, resolution — and groups **near-duplicates**. The flags follow the
   thresholds in *Settings → Captioning & quality*; because the raw scores are
   stored, tuning a threshold re-sorts the bank instantly, no rescan. The same
   pass also answers two questions the file itself lies about — see
   *Is this image really what it says it is?* below.
3. **Cull** — use the filter chips (Blurry, Noisy, ⬜ Flat, Small,
   Soft detail, Black bars, ≈ Duplicates) to review the worst
   offenders first. **Auto-reject
   flagged…** clears whole categories in one click (your manual ✓/✕ are never
   flipped). In the Duplicates view, resolve every group at once with **keep
   best** (highest resolution, then sharpest) or **keep first**, or pick the
   keeper by eye.
4. **Group by person** — the face pass (needs the Quality tools from Setup)
   detects the dominant face of every remaining image and clusters the bank by
   person, *no reference photo needed*. Click a person card to see only them,
   select all, keep or reject. Embeddings are cached, so re-running after a
   cull is much faster.
5. **Caption & search** — caption the bank with the same engines your
   datasets use (JoyCaption / Ollama vision, your *Settings*). Hit **Caption
   all** to describe every not-yet-captioned image, or select some first to
   caption just those. It runs in the background, frees the GPU like the other
   passes, and is Stop-able mid-run. The captions are plain descriptions (no
   trigger word, nothing omitted) whose real job is **search**: type into the
   search box — `red dress`, `sunset`, a file name — and the grid filters to
   matching images, combinable with every other filter. It's the fast way to
   find shots in a 9 000-image dump.
6. **Promote** — the kept images are **copied** into the dataset you choose
   through the normal import path: normalized to webp, near-duplicates already
   in the dataset skipped. Any bank caption **rides along**, so a captioned
   selection starts already captioned in the dataset. From there they get
   everything datasets have — captions, watermark cleaning, face scoring against
   a reference, training.

Work the funnel in that order: quality first (cheap, catches the trash), then
subject, then selection. A promoted image keeps its badge in the bank so you
always know what's been used where.

**Keeping the list readable.** A bank is named once, at creation — and *One bank
per subfolder* names them after the folders — so the list gets unwieldy fast.
Click the **✎** next to a bank's name to rename it: only the label changes, the
source folder, the images and every ✓/✕ stay exactly where they are. The **Sort**
menu above the cards reorders the list (newest or oldest first, name A→Z or Z→A,
most images, least triaged) and remembers your choice between visits.

**You can curate while a pass is running.** Opening another bank and accepting or
rejecting images while a scan — or the whole Launch-all queue — is working is
supported and safe. If a save happens to land at the exact moment a pass is
writing, the app waits and replays it for you; in the rare case it still can't
get through you'll see "the database is busy… try again in a moment", and
clicking again is all it takes. Your decision is never partially applied.

**🎨 Curate down to the right subset.** Culling removes the bad shots; curation
picks the *good* subset — and it's most of what makes a LoRA good. Once **✨
Score** has run (it caches a CLIP embedding per image), the **Curate** row under
the selection bar offers two selectors that cost no extra GPU time:

- **🎨 Pick diverse** — enter a number and it selects the images that best
  *cover the variety* of what you're looking at (varied angles, outfits, scenes),
  instead of that many near-identical frames. It's the antidote to a dump of
  4 000 shots of the same pose: ask for 60 and you get 60 that actually differ.
- **🎯 Similar to selected** — select **one** image as a reference, and it ranks
  everything by how much it looks like that image and selects the closest N — the
  fast way to pull one person or one look out of a mixed export.

Both honour whatever filter and 🔍 search are active ("the 60 most diverse of
*this* subfolder"), and both just **select** — the images light up and you review
them with the same ✓ Keep / ✕ Reject / ⬆ Promote bar. Nothing is auto-kept or
deleted, so a selection you don't like costs one click to clear.

**📐 Classify framing** tags every non-rejected image by *shot type* — face
close-up, bust, full body or back view — using the same detector the datasets
use. The result becomes a row of **📐 Framing** filter chips (compose with every
other filter and search), so balancing a character set's angles is a couple of
clicks. It's a GPU vision pass; add it to **🚀 Launch all** to have it run
overnight with the rest.

**📊 Coverage advice** (idea by [@antonp](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio))
is a read-only panel next to the Curate row. From what you've **kept** (or every
non-rejected image before you've kept anything), it says in plain sentences what
leans and what's thin for a good LoRA — *"70% face shots, add body/back"*,
*"person #1 is 60% of the set — one subject or a mix?"*, *"only 8 kept, most
families want 20+"*. It's **advice only** — nothing is kept or rejected — and
pure maths on data the passes already computed, so it costs no GPU. The
framing-balance line needs the 📐 Framing pass to have run; without it the panel
still covers person mix, style spread and resolution and hints to run framing.
**🗑 Delete rejected from disk** (next to Promote) is the one exception to the
"your source folder is never modified" rule, and it's opt-in. Once you're happy
with your triage, it removes every image you marked ✕ rejected from its source
folder — the actual files, not just the status. It asks you to type **DELETE**
first, and tells you where the files will go before you confirm: your OS trash
when [`send2trash`](https://pypi.org/project/Send2Trash/) is installed, the
app's own Trash otherwise (recoverable until you empty it from Settings), and a
permanent delete only when neither can take the file. Kept and undecided images
are never touched, and a file it can't remove (locked, read-only) is reported
and left alone rather than aborting the batch.

⚠️ A bank doesn't own its folder, so two banks can point at nested folders and
list the **same files**. That's harmless while you triage — decisions live on
the bank — but deleting from disk in one bank removes those files from the other
too, along with every decision you made on them there. The app says so when you
create such a bank, and the confirmation names the other bank and how many of
its files are about to disappear.

**🚀 Launch all** does the whole funnel for you in one go. Tick which passes
run and how auto-reject behaves, hit Go, and walk away — it chains *scan →
auto-reject → score → find watermarks → group by person → classify framing →
(optional) caption* in that exact order. Two things make it safe to run overnight: a pass whose
tool isn't installed, or a moment when the GPU is busy with a training run, is
**skipped with a reason** instead of failing the whole run; and because
auto-reject runs *before* the heavy passes, scoring/watermarks/person only ever
process the survivors, never the images you just rejected. Captioning is the one
pass left **off by default** (it's the slowest GPU pass and a clean-up run
rarely needs a description on every shot). Stop it any time — and when you come
back, a saved report at the top of the bank tells you exactly what ran, what was
skipped and why, with the headline counts.

Got several banks to clean? Instead of babysitting them one at a time, open a
bank's Launch-all dialog from the Banks page and choose **Add to queue**. The
**Launch-all queue** works through the banks one at a time, each one waiting its
turn for the GPU rather than failing when another bank — or a training run — is
using it. A panel on the Banks page shows what's running and what's lined up, and
lets you cancel a bank or clear the whole queue. Queue three exports before bed
and they'll be triaged by morning.

## Is this image really what it says it is?

Two things a file will happily lie about, both measured by the ordinary
**Scan quality** pass — plain CPU work, no extra install, no GPU.

**Its size.** An image enlarged from 512 px to 2048 px still *reports* 2048, so
it walks into a dataset as a high-resolution shot and the LoRA learns
interpolated mush. The scan measures how far real detail actually goes and says
it in pixels on the image's details line: *"2048 px stored · ~512 px of real
detail"*. The worst offenders sit behind the **Soft detail** filter chip,
and *Settings → Captioning & quality → Real-detail minimum* moves the bar.

Treat it exactly like the sharpness score: **a shortlist, not a verdict.** A
photo with motion blur, a portrait with the background thrown out of focus, and
a heavily denoised phone shot all genuinely lack fine detail and all read the
same way as an enlargement — which is fine for choosing training images (a LoRA
learns as little from either), but it is not proof the image was ever resized.
Look before you mass-reject. Two honest limits: a *nearest-neighbour* enlargement
is invisible to it (blocky pixels are real high-frequency detail), and large
enlargements are under-stated, so the pixel figure ranks images rather than
recovering the original file's size.

**Where it came from.** The scan reads the file's own metadata and sorts the
bank with the **Origin** chips:

- **AI** — the file still carries generation metadata: a ComfyUI workflow
  in the PNG, A1111-style `parameters`, or the C2PA/XMP "generated" marker the
  commercial generators write. Certain when present.
- **Camera** — the file still carries camera EXIF (make, model, exposure).
  Strong evidence it was actually photographed.
- **Unknown** — nothing left to read. **This is the normal answer**, not a
  failure: scrapers, chat apps and social networks strip metadata on sight (on a
  36 000-image Telegram export, *every single file* landed here). It is not
  evidence the image is a real photo, and it is not evidence it is AI — it is
  the absence of evidence, which is why it is its own answer instead of being
  quietly folded into "not AI".

On an image whose metadata is gone, the details line may add a *hint* when the
dimensions are a standard generator size (1024×1024, 832×1216, 896×1152…) and
there is no camera EXIF. It says it is a hint; plenty of crops and downloads
land on round numbers too.

Two smaller facts come free with the same pass: **Black bars** flags flat
letterbox/pillarbox padding (video screenshots, stills padded into a square,
which survive a training crop), and the **JPEG quality** of the last save is
shown as-is — a low figure means the file has been through a re-encoding
pipeline, but it is far too common to be worth a filter.

A bank you already scanned picks all of this up on its next **Scan** — the
pass re-visits the images that predate these measurements on its own. You do not
need a full rescan.

## Review a bank one image at a time

Filter chips and bulk actions clear the obvious trash, but the last call —
*is this shot good enough for the LoRA?* — is made one image at a time, and
squinting at a 140-pixel thumbnail is not how you make it. **▶ Review one by
one** (above the grid) opens the images of the **current filter** full size, one
after the other:

- **✓ Keep**, **✕ Reject**, **⏭ Skip** — each one saves and jumps straight to the
  next image. The keyboard is the point: **K** keep, **R** reject, **S** skip,
  **←/→** move without deciding, **Esc** to leave. A few hundred images go by in
  minutes.
- **⏭ Skip** decides nothing (the image stays undecided) but is not shown again
  in that run — it's "not now", not "no".
- **🎲 Random order** walks what's left in shuffled order instead of folder
  order. On a scraped dump of 3 000 photos, sequential order means 200
  near-identical frames in a row; random gives you a representative sample from
  the first click. Ticking or unticking it mid-run only re-orders what you have
  **not** seen yet — nothing you already judged comes back.
- Under the image, the facts the passes already computed (resolution, sharpness,
  aesthetic score, NSFW, quality flags, person and duplicate groups) so you can
  call it without leaving the lightbox.
- The counter is honest — *12 / 340* over the snapshot taken when you opened the
  review, so a decision that drops the image out of the filter can't make the
  run skip images or loop. Each decision is saved on the spot: close after fifty
  of them and all fifty are there.

The ▶ button on a tile starts the same review **at that image**. A plain click
on a tile still selects it for the bulk ✓/✕/⬆ bar, so both ways of working stay.

## Clean the watermarks a bank found

**🚩 Find watermarks** flags the images carrying an overlaid logo, URL or
@username. Removing them used to mean promoting the watermark into a dataset
first and cleaning it there; the bank now does it itself, in **two steps you
launch by hand** — cheapest and safest first:

1. **✂ Auto-crop** cuts off the marks sitting in a border strip. No model, no
   GPU, no invented pixel: it simply trims the band up to the mark, and only
   when the image stays big enough to train on. Anything it can't crop that way
   is left flagged, on purpose.
2. **🧽 Inpaint** repaints what's left. **LaMa** (fast, non-generative) handles
   small off-centre marks and leaves marks *on the subject* flagged; **Klein**
   (slower, via ComfyUI) also clears those. Each engine says what to install
   when it isn't ready, and the button stays off rather than failing mid-pass.

Each step shows how many images it still has to work on and how many it has
already handled, so you can see where the funnel stands. **Your source files are
never modified** — a cleaned image is a copy the app keeps beside the bank's
thumbnails. That copy is what the grid shows, and what **⬆ Promote** sends to
the dataset, so a cleaned bank produces a clean dataset. **↩ Undo cleaning**
just deletes those copies and flags the images again, and **👁 Before / after**
flips a sample between the cleaned version and your untouched original.

If a bank was scanned by an older version, its flagged images carry no recorded
mark position; the panel says so and one more **🚩 Find watermarks** run makes
them cleanable.


## Move a bank folder to another disk

A bank points at a folder *in place*, but nothing it computes lives in that
folder: the quality scores, duplicate groups, face clusters, captions and every
keep/reject decision are stored against the image row, and each row remembers
its file *relative* to the bank's folder. So moving a 30 000-image bank to
another drive costs nothing — you just have to tell the app where it went.

You can do this in either order. **📦 Move folder…** sits in the bank's header
next to its path (and **📦** on the bank's card in the list), so you can open it
before touching anything to see what the app will ask for; it also appears inside
the warning shown once the app notices the folder is gone, if you moved first.
Paste or browse to the new folder
and press **🔍 Check this folder**. Nothing is written yet: the app walks the
candidate folder and tells you how many of *this bank's* images are in there and
how many are not. Paste it however you like — Windows' *Copy as path* wraps the
path in quotes, and a trailing `\` or forward slashes are equally fine; the field
then shows the folder the app actually resolved, so what you confirm is what it
will use.

- **All of them found** → confirm, and the bank is repointed with every score
  and decision intact.
- **Some found, some missing** → you can still confirm. Nothing is deleted:
  rows whose file didn't come along keep their analysis and simply read as
  missing until the file comes back.
- **None found** → refused. That folder is a *different* folder, not a moved
  one — the usual cause is picking the parent of the folder you moved.

The app never deletes a row on its own, and an analysis pass run while the files
are away no longer degrades them either: a file that is *absent* is not a file
that is *broken*, so the pass stops and tells you the folder appears to have
moved instead of marking thousands of images unusable.


## Make Score use a GPU Python you already have

The **✨ Score** pass (aesthetic · NSFW · style) runs in its own small Python
environment, and that environment deliberately carries **CPU-only PyTorch**: a
first install stays a few hundred megabytes instead of pulling ~2.5 GB of CUDA
wheels onto machines that may have no card at all.

On a machine that *does* have one, that default is expensive — CLIP measures
about **336 ms per image on the CPU against ~15 ms on a recent card**, so a
30 000-image bank is the difference between a coffee break and most of an
afternoon. The bank says so: when Score is about to run on the CPU on a machine
with an NVIDIA card, an amber note gives you the estimate and a button, **⚡ Use
a GPU Python I already have**.

That button is the point. If you train LoRAs or run ComfyUI, this machine
*already* has a PyTorch with working CUDA. Score can simply borrow it — no
download, no third environment to maintain.

The dialog lists the interpreters the app knows about (the environment it built
for scoring, ai-toolkit's, ComfyUI's, its own) and reports each one **package by
package**:

- **GPU ready** — everything the pass imports is there *and* PyTorch sees the
  card. Pick it and the next Score run is minutes instead of hours.
- **Missing packages** — the reason is named. The common one is an interpreter
  with a perfect CUDA PyTorch but no **OpenCLIP**: Score needs `open_clip` and
  `transformers`/`timm` too, so CUDA alone is not enough. Such an interpreter is
  **refused**, on purpose — accepting it would trade slow-but-working scoring for
  an import error an hour into the pass.
- **CPU only** — it can run the pass, it just has no usable CUDA.
- **No answer** — the path is not a working interpreter (moved venv, unplugged
  drive). Nothing changes.

**The app never installs anything into an environment it did not create.** Your
ai-toolkit venv runs your training and ComfyUI's runs your generation; a silent
`pip install` into either is not something a dataset tool gets to do. When a
package is missing the dialog shows you the exact command and leaves the choice
to you — run it in a terminal, then hit **↻ Check again** and the row updates.

**Not listed? That field is not a fallback.** Most machines have neither
ai-toolkit nor ComfyUI where the app looks — or at all — so entering a path
yourself is a first-class route, checked exactly the same way. Paste an
interpreter *or* the environment folder that contains it: a venv, a conda or
miniconda env, a uv venv, a portable bundle, the system Python, something on a
second disk. Spaces, accents and quotes around the path are fine ("Copy as path"
on Windows wraps it in quotes; that is handled). The layout is never assumed —
the app knocks on the shapes an environment can have and keeps whichever one
actually answers.

No version of PyTorch or CUDA is required. The only question asked is the one
that matters: do the packages import, and does PyTorch see a card. An old card
on cu118, a 50-series that only works on cu128, a nightly build — all fine.

**No NVIDIA card?** Then there is nothing to fix, and the app says so plainly
instead of suggesting a CUDA install you could not use. Borrowing an interpreter
is still offered, for one honest reason: if another Python here already has the
packages, you can skip installing them a second time. It will not be faster.

**Back to the app default** puts everything back exactly as it was. The choice is
reversible at any time, and the note under the passes always says which
interpreter is in use. If you never open this dialog, nothing changes: an install
that works today keeps working, untouched.

## The LoRA Canvas (every run on one board)

**Canvas** in the top bar opens a single board holding the training history of
every dataset you have. Each dataset gets a lane; inside a lane, each run is a
card and each save it wrote is a small pill underneath it. When a run continued
from an earlier one, the line between them starts at the *exact* checkpoint it
resumed from — so "where did this LoRA come from" is a thing you read, not a
thing you reconstruct.

**Choosing what is on the board.** Everything is on it by default. The
**Datasets** control above the board unticks what you do not want to see; the
choice is remembered. On a phone it opens folded, with the current state written
on the button ("3 of 7") so you always know what you are looking at.

**Moving around.** Drag the background to pan, use the wheel (or two fingers) to
zoom, and **Fit** puts the whole board back in view. The board only fits itself
automatically until you first touch it — after that a dataset finishing its load
never yanks your view away.

**Reading a run.** Click a run card to open its inspector: the settings it
trained with, its notes, and a note per checkpoint. **Shift-click two** run cards
to compare their settings side by side, with the differences highlighted — and
because every dataset is on the same board, those two runs no longer have to
belong to the same dataset.

**Arranging the board.** Drag a run card and it stays where you put it, across
reloads. On a phone, moving a card and scrolling the board are the same gesture,
so a card is picked up with a **long press** — rest your finger on it for a
moment and it lifts; a finger that slides straight away scrolls as usual.

Once you have moved anything in a lane, that whole lane stops rearranging itself:
a training run that finishes later lands in free space next to your layout
instead of pushing everything sideways, which is what would otherwise happen —
the automatic tree centres each run over its continuations, so one new branch
re-flows the lane around it. Lanes you have never touched keep following the
automatic tree, because there is no arrangement to protect there.

**✦ Tidy up** is the way back: it forgets every card you have moved on the lanes
currently shown and rebuilds the automatic tree. Positions are only ever a
display preference — moving a card never changes which run continued which, and
Tidy up never deletes a run, a checkpoint or a note.

**Generating from the board.** Every checkpoint pill carries a small **✓** box.
Tick one and the run settings open beside the board: the prompt, the seed, the
format, the steps, the engine settings — the Test Studio's own panel, not a
lookalike, so anything the Test Studio can do the board can do too.

What the board adds is that your picks do not have to belong to the same
dataset. Tick a checkpoint in one lane and two in another and they run together
on one shared prompt and one shared seed, which is the only honest way to
compare LoRAs against each other.

Two things it will tell you rather than fail at:

- **A checkpoint that is not in ComfyUI yet** is still pickable. The button then
  says what it is about to do — *"Deploy 2 checkpoints, then generate"* — and
  waits for you. Nothing is copied into your ComfyUI folder by a button that did
  not announce it, and if a copy fails, nothing generates: half a comparison
  answers a different question than the one you asked.
- **Two different families in one selection** (say Krea and Z-Image) is refused,
  and it says which two. This is not a restriction we chose: those families do
  not share a base model or a workflow, so there is no single run that can render
  both. Unpick one family and the button comes back.

**The gallery under a checkpoint.** Images pile up. A checkpoint that has
produced more than one shows a small **× N** badge; clicking it opens everything
that checkpoint ever made, newest first — from the board, from the Test Studio,
from a comparison run, it does not matter. Regenerating no longer replaces what
was there.

Which image belongs to which checkpoint is recorded when the image is generated.
Images made before that was recorded are matched back where the evidence allows
it (the run tag the deploy stamps into the LoRA's name); those that cannot be
traced are **counted and left out** rather than shown under a checkpoint they
might not belong to. The gallery says how many those are — they are still in the
Test Studio, they simply have no node to sit under.

The graph embedded in a dataset's *Checkpoints & LoRAs* panel is unchanged and
still holds the per-checkpoint actions (download, deploy, continue from here,
inline previews). The canvas is a second way in, not a replacement.

## Tips that save runs

- Trust the composition meter over your instinct — a set that "looks varied"
  is usually still face-heavy.
- Fix every leak the badge reports before training; one "a woman with long
  blonde hair" caption quietly competes with your trigger.
- Don't chase steps. Train the auto count, then let the Test Studio find the
  *earliest* checkpoint that nails the identity — it keeps the most prompt
  flexibility.
- The next chapter — **Building a good dataset** — explains *why* behind every
  rule above. Read it once before your first serious run.
