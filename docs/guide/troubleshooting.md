# Troubleshooting

Symptom-first, most-reported first. If your problem isn't here, the next
chapter (**Getting help**) shows how to report it with one click.

## "No Z-Image model available" in the Test Studio or training panel

**Why:** the Test Studio generates through ComfyUI, so the Z-Image *base model*
must physically live in your ComfyUI install — and the scanner only accepts it
inside a sub-folder whose name contains `z image` (or `zimage`). A file dropped
loose in `models/unet` is **not** detected.

**Fix:** lay the stack out like this inside your ComfyUI folder, then re-test:

```
models/unet/z image/<your Z-Image checkpoint>.safetensors
models/text_encoders/Z image/qwen_3_4b.safetensors
models/vae/z ae.safetensors
```

A Z-Image LoRA only works on a Z-Image base — a regular SD/SDXL graph
(20–30 steps, CFG 7) renders garbage; Z-Image-Turbo wants euler / simple /
**8 steps / CFG 1.0** (the app's workflows already do this).

## "No SDXL checkpoint found" on a fresh install

**Why:** the app derives the models folder from **Settings → Local tools →
ComfyUI install directory**. If only the API URL is set, there's nothing to scan.

**Fix:** point the install directory at the folder that contains `models/` and
`main.py` (the Setup wizard detects it for you), then hit **Test**. SDXL
checkpoints are scanned from `models/checkpoints`.

## The Krea 2 Turbo Test Studio says a custom node is missing

**Why:** the Krea grid rebalances the Qwen3-VL conditioning through a small
community node (class `ConditioningKrea2Rebalance`). It isn't a stock ComfyUI
node, so a ComfyUI that doesn't have it can't run the Krea pipeline and the
Studio stops before wasting a run — the same up-front check used for missing
model files.

**Fix:** install the **ComfyUI-Conditioning-Rebalance** pack (in ComfyUI-Manager,
search **"Krea 2 Conditioning"** — repo
`https://github.com/nova452/ComfyUI-Conditioning-Rebalance`), then restart
ComfyUI and relaunch the test. The Studio's error banner names this pack and
links it directly. Either that original pack or its `comfyui-krea2-conditioning`
fork works — the app pins the node so your rebalance-strength setting is applied
the same way on both.

## The reference crop isn't centered on the face

**Why:** on a fresh clone the configured Ollama vision model isn't pulled yet,
so head detection silently falls back to a centered square crop. The app now
shows a warning toast naming the missing model when this happens.

**Fix:** **Setup → Ollama** — pull the vision model (use the **Instruct**
variant, not *Thinking*), or click the tile's crop button and frame it by hand.
**↺ Reset to auto** re-runs the auto-crop after the model is installed.

## Training log looks frozen for several minutes

**Why:** ai-toolkit's output is block-buffered during model load and latent
caching — nothing prints even though it's working. A "warming up" phase before
the first logged step is expected, and Krea-2-Raw runs are *hours* long by
design.

**Fix:** nothing to fix — check GPU utilization or watch the ai-toolkit output
folder for new files if you want proof of life. Open **Runs** to watch live
progress for the current local training.

## ai-toolkit isn't detected (conda / uv / no venv)

**Why:** the app auto-detects ai-toolkit's Python from a `venv/` or `.venv/`
folder next to its `run.py`. Installs that use conda, uv or the system Python
have no such folder, so the Test button can't find an interpreter — training
and JoyCaption stay hidden.

**Fix:** in **Settings → Local tools → ai-toolkit**, keep the directory pointing
at the ai-toolkit folder and fill the optional **Python interpreter** field with
the full path to the python that has ai-toolkit's dependencies (e.g.
`C:\miniconda3\envs\aitk\python.exe`), then hit **Test**. ComfyUI Desktop installs
are recognized automatically — no extra step.

## Reddit scan says "rate limiting requests, retry in Ns" (429)

**Why:** out of the box, Reddit scans authenticate with a **public client id
shared by many people** (the gallery-dl one). Reddit's quota — about 1000
requests per 10-minute window — is attached to that id, so other users can
exhaust it before your very first scan of the day. The "retry in Ns" number is
just the time left in the current 10-minute window.

**Fix:** get your own free client ID (one minute, no app secret involved):
**Settings → Scraping & sources** has the field plus a built-in step-by-step
guide. The one trap: on reddit.com/prefs/apps, pick the app type
**installed app** — a *web app* or *script* id comes with a client secret and
Reddit then rejects the anonymous login this app uses (every scan fails
with 401). Takes effect immediately, no restart needed.

## ComfyUI shows as unreachable

Check **Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI API URL** (default
`http://127.0.0.1:8188`), confirm ComfyUI is actually running, and check that a
firewall or a different bind interface isn't blocking the connection. The
**Test** button answers immediately.

## Klein engine stays greyed out

Klein needs a reachable ComfyUI **and** the Klein model files (~16 GB VRAM
class). **Setup → ComfyUI** offers the download; the license-gated fp8 model
needs a Hugging Face token (Settings → Local tools).

## The browser opens "cannot connect" at startup

Fixed as of 2026-07-22 — update & restart if you still see it. The launcher
used to open a hardcoded `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` *before* the server had
started, so any setup serving on a LAN or Tailscale `server.host` was greeted
with a dead tab every launch. It now opens the address the server is actually
bound to, only once the server accepts connections (with the access token
attached when the token gate is on). Don't want a tab at all — for example when
you only ever open the app from another device? Set `LDS_NO_BROWSER=1` before
launching.

## A Stop button doesn't seem to stop anything

As of 2026-07-22 every Stop in the app reports honestly instead of assuming:

- **Stop training** kills the training process and then *verifies it died*
  before saying so. If the process can't be confirmed dead within a few
  seconds you get an explicit error — retry the Stop, or check Task Manager
  for a wedged `python` process.
- **Stop generation** removes the queued renders immediately and asks ComfyUI
  to abort the one in flight. If ComfyUI is unreachable and can't confirm the
  abort, the app says the render *may still be running* rather than claiming
  success — the running render finishes on the GPU but its output is discarded.
- **Stop captioning** finishes the image currently being written, keeps
  everything captioned so far, and frees the GPU. The button reads
  "Stopping…" until that image completes (bounded by the per-image timeout).

If a Stop button is greyed out, another batch on the same dataset (for
example a caption pass) is holding the activity slot; it re-enables the
moment that batch ends.

## Port 5000 conflict on macOS

macOS reserves port 5000 for AirPlay Receiver. Change the port in
**Settings → Server & access** (e.g. 5050) and restart.

## Garbled characters in the Windows console

Cosmetic only — some UTF-8 text renders wrong on the legacy console codepage.
The app itself is unaffected.

## `npm install` fails with `Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-<platform>-...`

Only relevant if you rebuild the frontend yourself (the repo ships `dist/`
prebuilt). It's a known npm bug: delete `frontend/node_modules` +
`frontend/package-lock.json` and run `npm install` again on this machine.
