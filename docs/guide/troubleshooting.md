# Troubleshooting

Symptom-first, most-reported first. If your problem isn't here, the next
chapter (**Getting help**) shows how to report it with one click.

## "No Z-Image model available" in the Test Studio or training panel

**Why:** the Test Studio generates through ComfyUI, so the Z-Image *base model*
must physically live in your ComfyUI install — and the scanner only accepts it
inside a sub-folder whose name contains `z image` (or `zimage`). A file dropped
loose in `models/unet` is **not** detected.

**Fix:** lay the stack out like this inside your ComfyUI folder, then re-test:

```
models/unet/z image/<your Z-Image checkpoint>.safetensors
models/text_encoders/Z image/qwen_3_4b.safetensors
models/vae/z ae.safetensors
```

**The text encoder and the VAE are flexible** — only the base model needs that
sub-folder. The app resolves those two itself: any capitalisation, any separator
and any sub-folder work, so `models/vae/z_ae.safetensors`, `models/vae/ae.safetensors`
(the name ComfyUI's own Z-Image page uses), `text_encoders/Z Image/qwen_3_4b.safetensors`
and a bare `text_encoders/qwen_3_4b.safetensors` are all found, including under an
`extra_model_paths.yaml` root. **Do not rename your files to match the layout above.**
If the app still says one is missing, the message lists what it accepted and where it
looked; you can also pin either file by hand with the `zimage.vae` /
`zimage.text_encoder` settings (see *Settings reference → Config-file-only settings*).

A Z-Image LoRA only works on a Z-Image base — a regular SD/SDXL graph
(20–30 steps, CFG 7) renders garbage. The two Z-Image builds then want opposite
sampler settings, and the Test Studio proposes the right pair per base model:
**Z-Image-Turbo** is guidance-distilled and wants euler / simple / **8 steps /
CFG 1.0**, while the non-distilled **Z-Image Base** needs roughly **30–50 steps at
CFG 3–5** (ComfyUI's own recommendation) — run Base at CFG 1 and it renders mush.
Those are starting points on a sweepable axis, not measured optima: the Studio grid
exists to let you find yours.

## "No SDXL checkpoint found" on a fresh install

**Why:** the app derives the models folder from **Settings → Local tools →
ComfyUI install directory**. If only the API URL is set, there's nothing to scan.

**Fix:** point the install directory at the folder that contains `models/` and
`main.py` (the Setup wizard detects it for you), then hit **Test**. SDXL
checkpoints are scanned from `models/checkpoints`.

## The Krea 2 Turbo Test Studio says a custom node is missing

**Why:** the Krea grid rebalances the Qwen3-VL conditioning through a small
community node (class `ConditioningKrea2Rebalance`). It isn't a stock ComfyUI
node, so a ComfyUI that doesn't have it can't run the Krea pipeline and the
Studio stops before wasting a run — the same up-front check used for missing
model files.

**Fix:** install the **ComfyUI-Conditioning-Rebalance** pack (in ComfyUI-Manager,
search **"Krea 2 Conditioning"** — repo
`https://github.com/nova452/ComfyUI-Conditioning-Rebalance`), then restart
ComfyUI and relaunch the test. The Studio's error banner names this pack and
links it directly. Either that original pack or its `comfyui-krea2-conditioning`
fork works — the app pins the node so your rebalance-strength setting is applied
the same way on both.

## The reference crop isn't centered on the face

**Why:** on a fresh clone the configured Ollama vision model isn't pulled yet,
so head detection silently falls back to a centered square crop. The app now
shows a warning toast naming the missing model when this happens.

**Fix:** **Setup → Ollama** — pull the vision model (use the **Instruct**
variant, not *Thinking*), or click the tile's crop button and frame it by hand.
**↺ Reset to auto** re-runs the auto-crop after the model is installed.

## Training log looks frozen for several minutes

**Why:** ai-toolkit's output is block-buffered during model load and latent
caching — nothing prints even though it's working. A "warming up" phase before
the first logged step is expected, and Krea-2-Raw runs are *hours* long by
design.

**Fix:** nothing to fix — check GPU utilization or watch the ai-toolkit output
folder for new files if you want proof of life. Open **Runs** to watch live
progress for the current local training.

## ai-toolkit isn't detected (conda / uv / no venv)

**Why:** the app auto-detects ai-toolkit's Python from a `venv/` or `.venv/`
folder next to its `run.py`. Installs that use conda, uv or the system Python
have no such folder, so the Test button can't find an interpreter — training
and JoyCaption stay hidden.

**Fix:** in **Settings → Local tools → ai-toolkit**, keep the directory pointing
at the ai-toolkit folder and fill the optional **Python interpreter** field with
the full path to the python that has ai-toolkit's dependencies (e.g.
`C:\miniconda3\envs\aitk\python.exe`), then hit **Test**. ComfyUI Desktop installs
are recognized automatically — no extra step.

## Reddit scan says "rate limiting requests, retry in Ns" (429)

**Why:** out of the box, Reddit scans authenticate with a **public client id
shared by many people** (the gallery-dl one). Reddit's quota — about 1000
requests per 10-minute window — is attached to that id, so other users can
exhaust it before your very first scan of the day. The "retry in Ns" number is
just the time left in the current 10-minute window.

**Fix:** get your own free client ID (one minute, no app secret involved):
**Settings → Scraping & sources** has the field plus a built-in step-by-step
guide. The one trap: on reddit.com/prefs/apps, pick the app type
**installed app** — a *web app* or *script* id comes with a client secret and
Reddit then rejects the anonymous login this app uses (every scan fails
with 401). Takes effect immediately, no restart needed.

## ComfyUI shows as unreachable

Check **Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI API URL** (default
`http://127.0.0.1:8188`), confirm ComfyUI is actually running, and check that a
firewall or a different bind interface isn't blocking the connection. The
**Test** button answers immediately.

## ComfyUI runs in another container (or WSL, or another machine) and generation fails

**Symptom:** setup goes green — the ComfyUI URL answers, the install directory is
accepted — and then every generation fails.

**Why:** the app talks to ComfyUI through **two** channels, and only one of them is
the network.

1. **The HTTP API** (`Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI API URL`). This is what the
   *Test* button and the Setup wizard check.
2. **The filesystem.** Every local engine (Klein, Krea 2 Edit, Klein watermark
   cleaning) hands ComfyUI its source image by **copying the file into ComfyUI's
   `input/` folder**, and the result comes back from its `output/` folder. There is
   no upload over the API on that path.

A ComfyUI in a separate container, in WSL, or on another host does not share those
folders with the app by default. The URL answers, so everything looks configured —
and then the copy writes into a folder ComfyUI cannot see, or fails outright.

**What it takes to work:**

- `input/` and `output/` must be visible **to both sides at the same path**. Not
  "an equivalent folder": the app writes `<input>/edit_source_….png` and then tells
  ComfyUI to load `edit_source_….png` from *its own* input folder — the two must be
  the same directory.
- The app's process must be able to **write** into `input/` (a read-only bind mount
  is not enough), and ComfyUI must be able to read it.
- If ComfyUI was started with `--input-directory` / `--output-directory`, set the
  matching paths in **Settings → Local tools → Advanced: ComfyUI folder overrides**.
  Those fields take the path **as seen by the app**.

With Docker, that means bind-mounting the same host folders into both containers at
identical paths, e.g.:

```yaml
# both services
volumes:
  - /srv/comfyui/input:/srv/comfyui/input
  - /srv/comfyui/output:/srv/comfyui/output
```

and then pointing the two override fields at `/srv/comfyui/input` and
`/srv/comfyui/output`. The shipped `docker-compose.yml` deliberately does **not**
do this: it runs the app in API-only mode, where ComfyUI is out of scope.

**How you'll know:** the failure now says so. Settings flags an override folder it
cannot write into, the Setup wizard warns while you configure (a warning, never a
blocker — mounting volumes afterwards is fine), and a generation that cannot reach
the folder answers with the folder path and the reason instead of a bare `500`.
Those messages are path-redacted, so they are safe to paste in a help thread.

**Everything else keeps working without shared folders**: scraping, curation,
captioning through Ollama, training, and Hugging Face publishing. Only the
ComfyUI engines need the filesystem.

*(Reported by nofaceman on Discord.)*

## "Value not in list" on every model, on Linux (fixed)

**Symptom:** on a Linux install, nothing generated at all. ComfyUI's console showed,
for every workflow:

```
Failed to validate prompt for output 28:
* UNETLoader 20:
  - Value not in list: unet_name: 'Krea\krea2_turbo_fp8.safetensors'
    not in ['Krea/krea2_turbo_fp8.safetensors']
```

**Why:** ComfyUI builds its model lists with the separator of **its own** host —
backslash on Windows, forward slash on Linux — and validates a model widget by
exact string match. The app spelled those names with a Windows backslash whatever
the platform, and it keeps every model in a subfolder (`Krea`, `klein`,
`z image`, and every LoRA you train), so on Linux the answer was "nothing works"
rather than "one model is missing".

**Fixed:** the app now reads the spelling from the ComfyUI it is actually talking
to and matches it. This also covers the reverse case — the app on Windows driving
a ComfyUI in WSL, Docker or on another machine, which needs forward slashes — so
there is nothing to configure either way.

*(Found and diagnosed by 1Tomber, [GitHub #21](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/issues/21).)*

## Klein engine stays greyed out

Klein needs a reachable ComfyUI **and** the Klein model files (~16 GB VRAM
class). **Setup → ComfyUI** offers the download; the license-gated fp8 model
needs a Hugging Face token (Settings → Local tools).

Whatever the cause, the greyed-out engine now **names it**, and the Setup wizard
shows the same sentence — the two screens read one verdict, so they cannot send
you to fix different things. The causes, and what each one means:

| What it says | What it means | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Configure ComfyUI in Settings` | ComfyUI is not answering | Start it, or fix the API URL |
| `Klein <file(s)> missing` | that weight is not on disk | Download it in Setup ▸ Install components |
| `… is on disk but cannot be loaded` | the file is there but unreadable | See below |
| `Your ComfyUI doesn't have <value>` | the graph pins a widget value your ComfyUI doesn't offer | Install the named node pack, restart ComfyUI |
| `disabled in Settings (engines)` | you turned the engine off | Re-enable it in Settings ▸ Engines |

### Where the Klein model may live — you do **not** need `models/unet/klein/`

`models/unet/klein/` is only where the Setup button *downloads* to. It has never
been a requirement, and nothing needs to be copied, moved or symlinked to satisfy
it. The app resolves the Klein UNET exactly where a running ComfyUI would, in
this order:

| Layout | Example |
| --- | --- |
| a `klein`-named sub-folder of `models/unet` | `models/unet/klein/flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8.safetensors` |
| **any** sub-folder whose name contains `klein`, any capitalisation or spacing | `models/unet/Flux2 Klein/…safetensors` |
| the **top level** of `models/unet` | `models/unet/flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8.safetensors` |
| the same three, under `models/diffusion_models` | `models/diffusion_models/flux2-klein-9b/…safetensors` |
| any root declared in your `extra_model_paths.yaml` | a Stability Matrix / portable / A1111-shared tree |
| a relocated models folder | **Settings → Local tools → ComfyUI models folder** |

**The one limit:** the model has to be *nameable* as Klein — either the **file
name** or its **sub-folder name** must contain `klein`. A file called
`model.safetensors` sitting loose in `diffusion_models/` is invisible; put it in
a `klein/` folder (any file name then works) or rename the file. That rule is
what stops another family's checkpoint being wired into the Klein graph.

Every row of that table is covered by
`backend/tests/test_klein_model_locations_documented.py`, so it cannot quietly
stop being true.

*(Reported by CyberTod on Reddit, who duplicated the weights and built a symlink
to reclaim the disk space — neither was necessary.)*

### "On disk but cannot be loaded"

A `.safetensors` file declares the length of its JSON header in its first eight
bytes. A download that was **cut short or corrupted** leaves a file that is
shorter than it claims — plausible size, right name, right folder, and no loader
can open it. A licence or login page saved as `.safetensors` fails the same way.

Setup used to tick these as **✓ Installed** (the file existed) while the
generation page refused the engine. It now shows **⚠ On disk, unreadable** with
the file name and the reason, and **↻ Download again** replaces the bad file
instead of reporting "already present" and doing nothing.

If you placed the file by hand somewhere other than the folder Setup downloads
into, delete it yourself first — the app only replaces files at its own path.

*(Reported by zigzag4794 on Discord.)*

### "Not checked" is not "ready"

With ComfyUI stopped, the checks that need it cannot run, and the app reports no
gap rather than inventing one. Your files being on disk is therefore **not** a
clean bill of health, and Setup says so instead of showing a tick it did not
earn. Start ComfyUI and re-check.

## "Upscale & improve" makes my anime look realistic

**Why:** the improve pass sends Klein a fixed instruction, and the shipped one is
a *photographic* recipe — `add detailed texture, add sharp details, add candid
shot, add soft focus effect`. It is applied to every dataset, drawn ones
included, so on anime or illustration it does exactly what it says: it adds skin
texture and photo micro-detail your line art never had.

**Fix — two levers, both in Settings → Image engines → *Identity & Klein prompts
(advanced)*:**

1. **Rewrite the instruction.** The *Klein upscale & improve prompt* box holds
   the text in use; edit it to something that suits drawn art (e.g. "keep the
   drawn anime rendering, clean line art, flat cel shading, sharpen the lines").
   Clearing the box restores the shipped default — nothing is frozen.
2. **Or send no instruction at all.** The checkbox above the box — *Apply an
   improvement prompt on "Klein upscale & improve"* — turns it off, and the pass
   becomes a pure upscale.

Separately, **Settings → Image engines → *Upscale & improve — strength*** decides
how far the pass may move the image at all (output megapixels, sampler steps, the
enhancement LoRA, the consistency LoRA). Lower the *Enhancement LoRA* and raise
the *Consistency LoRA* if you want the pass to change less.

Both are now quoted and linked **from the ✨ Upscale & improve button itself** —
in the lightbox and in the grid's bulk toolbar — so the instruction currently in
force is readable where the action happens, and anime datasets get an explicit
warning there.

## The browser opens "cannot connect" at startup

Fixed as of 2026-07-22 — update & restart if you still see it. The launcher
used to open a hardcoded `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` *before* the server had
started, so any setup serving on a LAN or Tailscale `server.host` was greeted
with a dead tab every launch. It now opens the address the server is actually
bound to, only once the server accepts connections (with the access token
attached when the token gate is on). Don't want a tab at all — for example when
you only ever open the app from another device? Set `LDS_NO_BROWSER=1` before
launching.

## A Stop button doesn't seem to stop anything

As of 2026-07-22 every Stop in the app reports honestly instead of assuming:

- **Stop training** kills the training process and then *verifies it died*
  before saying so. If the process can't be confirmed dead within a few
  seconds you get an explicit error — retry the Stop, or check Task Manager
  for a wedged `python` process.
- **Stop generation** removes the queued renders immediately and asks ComfyUI
  to abort the one in flight. If ComfyUI is unreachable and can't confirm the
  abort, the app says the render *may still be running* rather than claiming
  success — the running render finishes on the GPU but its output is discarded.
- **Stop captioning** finishes the image currently being written, keeps
  everything captioned so far, and frees the GPU. The button reads
  "Stopping…" until that image completes (bounded by the per-image timeout).

If a Stop button is greyed out, another batch on the same dataset (for
example a caption pass) is holding the activity slot; it re-enables the
moment that batch ends.

## Is it stuck? — the Activity panel

Every long job in LDS has a progress bar, and every bar lives on the page that
owns it: a bank pass on that bank, a caption batch on that dataset, training on
Runs. So "is anything actually moving?" used to cost a tour of the app — and a
percentage cannot answer it anyway, because **a bar frozen at 34% and a bar that
will move again in two seconds are drawn identically**.

**📋 in the top bar** opens one panel that answers it, from any page:

- **Running now** — every live job across banks and datasets, with the **age of
  its last update**. That age is the whole point: a pass that reported two
  seconds ago is fine at 3%, and a pass that reported twelve minutes ago is
  stuck whatever its bar says. Past a minute of silence the row is flagged; past
  five it says *probably stuck*. Those thresholds are deliberately generous — a
  cold model load or a big folder walk can legitimately say nothing for a while,
  and a warning that cries wolf is one you stop reading.
- **The log** — a timestamped feed of passes starting, finishing, stopping and
  failing, plus the GPU being taken and released. It appends as it arrives and
  never redraws, so scrolling up to read something does not yank you back down.

The GPU lines are worth knowing about: taking the exclusive window unloads
ComfyUI and blocks training, and until now it did all of that with no visible
trace anywhere. If the panel says the GPU was taken and never released, that is
the *"GPU busy" when nothing is running* case below.

Two things this panel is **not**. It is not the server log — Settings ▸
Maintenance still tails that, and it is a developer artefact (Flask lines,
tracebacks, request noise); this one is the app's own account of its work, in
the words the UI uses. And it is **not kept across a restart**, because it
describes work that does not survive one either; a log full of jobs that are no
longer running would be a lie.

## "GPU busy" when nothing is running

Every GPU pass, every queued bank and every training start is gated on two
flags the app keeps: *training in progress* and *a vision/GPU pass in
progress*. They are set when work takes the card and cleared when it lets go.
If a process dies without letting go — ComfyUI gone, a borrowed Python that
never returned, a helper wedged on CUDA start-up — the flag stays set and
**everything afterwards refuses with a "GPU busy" that is not true**. The flag
has a timer, but it does not save you: an alive-but-stuck process keeps
refreshing it, so this used to mean restarting the app.

Two ways out, and the first is almost always the right one:

- **Clear the leftover flag.** Where the refusal appears — the bank workspace,
  the banks page, and Settings ▸ Maintenance — a warning shows up *only when
  the server has checked and found nothing behind the flag*, with a **Clear
  it — nothing is using the GPU** button. It stops nothing; it just corrects
  the app's belief. If something really is running you will not see it, and
  pressing it anyway is refused rather than allowed to break your own job.
- **⏹ Stop everything** (Settings ▸ Maintenance) when work *is* wedged. It
  cancels queued and running bank passes, dataset batches and in-flight
  generations, asks ComfyUI to unload, stops training, then clears the flags.
  It confirms first — it is destructive to in-flight work by design. Passes
  that cache their progress (✨ Score, 👥 Group by person) resume where they
  stopped; anything mid-flight is lost.

**It reports per target, and it does not round up.** An unreachable ComfyUI is
reported as *not confirmed*, not as stopped. A training process that cannot be
confirmed dead is a **failure**, and its flag is deliberately *not* cleared —
saying the GPU is free while a trainer still holds it is how two runs end up on
one card. So a result listing one failure alongside four successes is the report
working, not the button half-failing.

**The most common cause of this on a working install** is pointing ✨ Score at a
CUDA interpreter (see *Using the app → Make Score use a GPU Python you already
have*). That makes Score take the GPU exclusively, which is correct — but a
borrowed interpreter that stalls on CUDA start-up used to hold the flag
indefinitely. A helper that produces no output for 15 minutes is now stopped
automatically and the GPU released.

## Port 5000 conflict on macOS

macOS reserves port 5000 for AirPlay Receiver. Change the port in
**Settings → Server & access** (e.g. 5050) and restart.

## Garbled characters in the Windows console

Cosmetic only — some UTF-8 text renders wrong on the legacy console codepage.
The app itself is unaffected.

## `npm install` fails with `Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-<platform>-...`

Only relevant if you rebuild the frontend yourself (the repo ships `dist/`
prebuilt). It's a known npm bug: delete `frontend/node_modules` +
`frontend/package-lock.json` and run `npm install` again on this machine.
