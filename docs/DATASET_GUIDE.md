# Building a good LoRA dataset

This guide condenses what actually moves the needle when training a character LoRA
with this app (ai-toolkit under the hood). Every number here matches what the app
enforces or defaults to — when in doubt, the app's warnings are this guide applied.

> **The one principle behind everything:** a LoRA learns whatever is **constant
> across your images and NOT described in the captions**. Keep the subject constant,
> vary everything else, and never describe the subject — that's the trigger word's job.

---

## 1. Pick your model family first

The family changes the caption style, the image count, and the settings — so decide
before you caption anything.

| | Z-Image | SDXL | Krea 2 | FLUX.1 | FLUX.2 Klein |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Caption style** | Prose sentences | Booru tags | Prose sentences | Prose sentences | Prose sentences |
| **Images (min → good)** | 12 → 20+ | 20 → 30+ | 15 → 20+ | 15 → 20+ | 15 → 20+ |
| **Training base** | Z-Image-Turbo (or a converted custom merge) | Your ComfyUI checkpoint (e.g. bigLove) | Krea-2-Raw (default) or Turbo | FLUX.1-dev (gated HF) | FLUX.2-klein-base 4B (default) or 9B (gated HF) |
| **Preview quality** | Fast, distilled | Depends on checkpoint | Raw: slow but faithful | High, ~20 steps | Non-distilled, real CFG (~25 steps) |
| **Best for** | Fast iteration, prose-driven prompting | Booru-native checkpoints, NSFW ecosystems | Highest realism ceiling | The largest LoRA ecosystem, strong prompt fidelity | Modern FLUX.2 stack; 4B trains on mid-range GPUs |

**Krea note:** the default trains on **Krea-2-Raw** — the official recommendation is
*"train on Raw, validate on Turbo"*. Raw runs are long (hours); that's normal, not stuck.

**FLUX.1 note:** trains on **FLUX.1-dev**, a *gated* Hugging Face model — accept its
license and set a HF token before the first run (the initial download is ~24 GB). It's
a 12B model like Krea 2, so **~24 GB VRAM** is the comfort zone (drop the resolution to
**768** to fit smaller cards). **Local training only for now**; in-app testing (Test
Studio) is coming — until then, test your Flux LoRA in your own ComfyUI.

**FLUX.2 Klein note:** two model sizes, picked next to the base selector — **4B**
(default) trains on a **16–24 GB** local GPU; **9B** needs **32–48 GB VRAM**.
Both bases are *gated* on Hugging Face: accept the license of
`FLUX.2-klein-base-4B` / `-9B` and set a HF token before the first run. In-app
testing (Test Studio) is coming — until then, test your Klein LoRA in your own
ComfyUI.

**Anima note (the one family that takes BOTH caption styles):** Anima is an anime
model with **hybrid prompting** — its model card documents *booru tags* and *natural
language* as equally supported, which its LLM text encoder is what makes possible. So
this is the family where the "match the style" rule below does **not** apply: caption
in prose, caption in booru tags, or keep an existing dataset as it is — the app will
not flag either as a mismatch, and you never have to force the launch. Prose is only
the preselected default. It trains on the open `Anima-Base-v1.0-Diffusers` (no gated
download) and is **local-only** for now.

---

## 2. How many images, and which ones

- **Target ~25 images** for a balanced character LoRA. More isn't automatically
  better — 25 varied images beat 60 near-duplicates every time.
- **Balance the framing.** The app tracks four buckets: **face / bust / body / back**.
  A dataset that is 100% face close-ups produces a LoRA that falls apart on
  full-body prompts — it has never seen the body.
- **Imported images may have no shot type yet.** Only images imported with the
  head-crop option on are tagged automatically; a plain drag-and-drop import (the
  default on body-fidelity datasets) leaves the shot type unknown, and unknown
  images count for nothing in the Composition bar — a whole import can leave it
  at 0. **📐 Classify framing (N)**, right under that bar in 📸 Add images, reads
  those images with the local vision model (Ollama) and sorts each into face /
  bust / body / back. It needs Ollama running with a vision model pulled
  (Settings ▸ Local tools); it uses the GPU and waits rather than competing with
  a training run. Nothing is deleted and images it cannot read stay unknown, so
  running it again only retries those.
- **Vary everything except the person:** location, lighting, outfit, pose,
  expression, camera angle. Whatever repeats across images gets baked into the
  LoRA — a repeated background wall becomes part of "the person".
- **Reject near-duplicates.** Two frames of the same shot teach nothing and
  overweight that look. The pre-flight check flags them; reject one of each pair.
- **Quality floor:** no motion blur, no heavy compression, the face readable.
  One bad image does more harm than one good image does good.

**Body fidelity mode** (Datasets → ⋯ More): use it when the body shape and body
marks (tattoos, scars) should bind to the trigger too. It shifts the composition
targets toward bust/body shots, imports full-frame by default, and extends the
caption rules below to body marks.

---

## 3. Captions — the make-or-break step

The model reads your captions during training and learns to attribute **whatever
the caption does NOT explain** to the trigger word.

**The golden rule: never describe what the person IS — describe everything else.**

- ❌ `myTrigger, a woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes, smiling` —
  the LoRA learns almost nothing: the caption already "explains" the appearance.
- ✅ `myTrigger, sitting at a café table, warm afternoon light, denim jacket,
  looking at the camera` — hair, face and skin are unexplained → they bind
  to `myTrigger`.

Concretely:

1. **Start every caption with the trigger word.** The app injects it on export.
2. **Never mention hair, face, eyes or skin.** The app's *identity-leak* check
   flags captions that do — fix every flagged one before training.
3. **Describe scene, outfit, pose, lighting, framing.** Those are the things you
   want to stay promptable *independently* of the identity.
4. **Vary the captions.** Identical captions across images teach nothing;
   captions under ~8 words are too weak to isolate the identity.
5. **Match the style to the family.** Prose for Z-Image and Krea; booru tags for
   SDXL booru-native checkpoints. The app blocks a mismatch for a reason —
   a prose-captioned SDXL LoRA produces disjointed images. **Anima is the
   exception:** it reads both forms natively, so neither is ever blocked there
   (see the Anima note above).

   ⚠️ **Concept datasets cannot be captioned in booru tags at all** (the concept
   captioner only writes prose). A Concept dataset on a booru-native SDXL
   checkpoint will therefore always be stopped by the caption-style check: train
   the concept on a prose family instead, or force the launch knowing the cost.

**Caption length.** ⚙️ *Options* on the Captions panel carries a **Caption length**
preset — *Standard* (the prompt untouched), *Concise* (aims for one short sentence,
~20–30 words) or *Detailed* (several sentences). It is a **target the vision model
follows loosely**, not a hard cap: expect a spread around it, not a word count. Pick
*Concise* when detailed captions keep describing the identity you want bound to the
trigger, *Detailed* when you want scene, outfit and lighting to stay independently
promptable.

What that looked like when measured — 18 real portrait photos, the shipped default
vision model (`huihui_ai/qwen3-vl-abliterated:8b-instruct`), the plain descriptive
prompt, one pass per preset:

| Preset | Median | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Concise | 24.5 words | 18–30 |
| Standard | 87.5 words | 65–112 |
| Detailed | 126 words | 106–152 |

Your numbers will differ — another vision model, JoyCaption, or a different kind of
image all move them. Treat the presets as *shorter / as-is / longer*, not as a
contract on a word count.

Two more things worth knowing:

- **Order.** The prompt is built as: the base prompt with its omission rules, then the
  vocabulary register, then the length preset, then your free **Extra instructions**
  last — so a hand-written steer that contradicts a preset is what the model reads
  most recently and wins. The identity/concept leak cleaners run after all of it
  regardless, so no wording here can reintroduce a banned term.
- **Concise is not the "short" of long + short captions.** Dual captions derive a
  short variant *from* the stored long caption into its own field; the length preset
  changes the long caption itself. They are separate axes and compose freely.
- Concise stays **prose** on purpose (never a comma-separated tag list), so a Concise
  dataset still passes the caption-style check for prose-native families instead of
  being mistaken for booru tags at launch.

**Concept datasets** (training a *thing/style/act*, not a person) invert the rule:
describe everything **except the concept** — the concept is what must bind to the
trigger. Keep *person* masking **off** for concepts — a person mask would erase the
very thing you're training. Masking **faces** is the opposite polarity and is
available on purpose: see §8.

**Stopping a run.** Started a big caption pass and realized it's captioning badly,
or an option was mis-set? A **⏹ Stop** button sits in the captioning progress
banner. It finishes the image being written (an inference is never cut off
mid-way), then stops cleanly: every caption written so far is kept, the rest is
left untouched, and you get a *"stopped — X captioned"* summary. Nothing is killed
and nothing already done is lost — just fix the option and run again on what's left.

---

## 4. Settings cheat-sheet

The defaults below are the app's defaults (post-research). Change them from
⚙️ Advanced options on the training panel — each knob has its own why/how there.
That panel also has a **Presets** row: apply a shipped ★ recipe (*Krea
character*, *Concept*, *Style*), or save your tuned settings as a named preset to
reuse across datasets and share (import/export as JSON).

| Setting | Z-Image | SDXL | Krea 2 | FLUX.1 | FLUX.2 Klein | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LoRA rank / alpha** | 16 / 16 | 32 / 16 | 32 / 32 | 16 / 16 | 16 / 16 | Capacity to memorize the identity. SDXL's alpha = rank ÷ 2 is that family's half-strength convention. |
| **Resolution** | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | 768 + 1024 | Multi-scale: holds up from close-up to full-body. |
| **Save checkpoint** | every 250 | every 250 | every 250 | every 250 | every 250 | More snapshots → better odds one is at the sweet spot. |
| **Steps** | auto | auto | auto | auto | auto | ~120 × images, clamped 1500–3500. A fixed 3000 overcooks small sets. |
| **Masked training** | ON | ON | ON | ON | ON | Background weighs only 10% of the loss → identity binds to the person, not the room. OFF for concepts — they have their own face masking instead (§8). |

Rules of thumb:

- **Raise rank (48–64)** only for a hard identity (distinctive features the
  default misses) *and* a bigger dataset — high rank on 15 images just memorizes them.
- **Don't chase steps.** More steps past the sweet spot = overfitting (plastic
  skin, same face angle everywhere, prompt deafness). Train with checkpoints
  every 250 and pick the best one instead.
- **Turbo variant (Krea)** is the VRAM/time-friendly fallback — fine for drafts,
  Raw for the final run.
- **GPU under 24 GB?** Resolution is the #1 memory lever: set it to **768 only**
  (Krea 2 especially — 1024 saturates a 24 GB card). You trade some fine detail
  for a run that actually fits and trains far faster.

### Steps — how many, and where "good results" start

The app sets the step count **automatically** for a character LoRA:
**≈ 120 × kept images, clamped to 1500–3500.** The *target is the same* for
Z-Image, SDXL, Krea 2, FLUX.1 and FLUX.2 Klein — the model family changes how *fast*
that target converges, not the number. (Concept/style datasets scale differently:
**475 · √n, clamped 2000–12000**, because they train on hundreds of images.)

So the character step count just follows your dataset size:

| Kept images | Auto steps |
|---|---|
| 12–15 | 1500 – 1800 |
| 20 | 2400 |
| 25 | 3000 |
| 30 and up | 3500 (capped) |

**"Good results" is a checkpoint you pick, not the finish line.** A snapshot is
saved every 250 steps, and the best one is almost never the last — later
checkpoints know the face better but obey prompts worse. *Where* the first
usable checkpoint appears depends on how fast the model converges:

| Model | Converges | Where the sweet spot tends to land |
|---|---|---|
| **Z-Image** | Fast (distilled) | Around the **middle** of the run; watch for overfit in the last ~20% (waxy skin, frozen expression) |
| **Krea 2 – Turbo** | Fast (distilled) | Like Z-Image — check early-to-middle checkpoints first |
| **SDXL** | Medium (base-dependent) | Middle of the run; booru-native checkpoints lock an identity quickly |
| **Krea 2 – Raw** | Slow (12B, non-distilled) | The **last third** — the run is long by design, let it finish the full count rather than stopping early |
| **FLUX.1-dev** | Medium (12B, guidance-distilled) | Middle of the run; a strong prompt-follower, so watch for waxy skin / frozen expression if you overshoot into the last ~20% |
| **FLUX.2 Klein (4B/9B)** | Medium (non-distilled base) | Middle of the run; previews run with real CFG so overfit shows honestly — pick the earliest checkpoint that holds the identity |

**Takeaway:** don't hand-tune the step number. Train the auto count, then use the
**Test Studio** to pick the *earliest* checkpoint that nails the identity — that's
the one with the most prompt flexibility left.

## 5. Pre-flight checklist

The app runs these checks when you hit Train — here's the list to self-check earlier:

- [ ] At least the family minimum kept (12 Z-Image / 20 SDXL / 15 Krea / 15 FLUX.1 / 15 FLUX.2 Klein) — 20–30 is the comfort zone
- [ ] Framing balanced — not 100% face shots (some bust/body/back)
- [ ] Every kept image captioned *(strongly recommended — a blank caption won't block the launch, it just asks you to confirm "train anyway")*
- [ ] **Zero identity leaks** (no hair/face/skin words — the leak badge shows 0)
- [ ] Captions varied, ≥ 8 words, style matches the family (prose vs booru — Anima takes either)
- [ ] Near-duplicate pairs resolved (keep one of each)
- [ ] Body fidelity: if ON, actual full-body shots exist

**Continue anyway.** When the readiness panel turns red over a *quality* blocker —
most often too few images for the family — a **Continue anyway** checkbox appears
under the list. Tick it and the Train button unlocks; the launch is recorded as
"acknowledged not-ready" in its saved config. It's meant for deliberate
experiments (you'll usually get an overfit LoRA), not for skipping the work. The
checkbox only ever covers quality guard-rails: genuine impossibilities that would
just crash the trainer — **zero kept images**, or a **slider with no prompt pair**
— are never offered the option, and the box un-ticks itself the moment the
blockers change.

**Stopping a training run.** The red **⏹ Stop training** button next to Train
ends the run in progress — it is not a housekeeping button. It kills the training
process, clears the pending local training queue, and hands the GPU back to
ComfyUI. What you keep: **every checkpoint already saved**, which stays testable
in the Studio and can be continued later with ▶ Continue. Because a run can be
hours long, the button asks for confirmation first. The same run can also be
stopped from the **Runs** hub ("Stop run"), which does exactly the same thing.

---

## 6. After training: pick the right checkpoint

Training produces a checkpoint every 250 steps — **the last one is often NOT the
best one**. Later checkpoints know the identity better but obey prompts worse.

1. Open the **Test Studio** from the dataset (the LoRA comes pre-selected).
2. Generate the same prompt grid across several checkpoints and strengths.
3. Pick the **earliest checkpoint that nails the identity** — it keeps the most
   prompt flexibility. Signs you've gone too far: waxy skin, identical
   expression/angle regardless of prompt, outfits from the dataset bleeding in.
4. Save the winning settings (★) — they're reused as the dataset's defaults.

### Test several prompts in one launch

Under the prompt box is the history of the prompts you have saved, with a
thumbnail of the image you liked best for each. Clicking a card loads it into the
field, as before. **Ticking its box adds it to a batch**: the panel counts what is
selected, the button says how many prompts it is about to run, and one launch
renders them all — same checkpoints, same settings, **same seed**, which is what
makes two prompts comparable rather than two unrelated pictures.

It is one run, not several: the images queue up and the GPU works through them by
itself. Tick nothing and the screen behaves exactly as it always has, running the
prompt in the field. The cap is 24 prompts per launch — past that the launch is
refused with the count rather than quietly rendering half of them.

The same tick boxes are in **🎨 Generate from the board** on the ◉ LoRA Canvas,
because both screens show the same prompt history.

### Compare LoRAs — or blend them

Check two or more LoRAs and Studio asks what you want to do with them:

- **⚖ Compare** (the default) tests each LoRA **on its own**, one column per LoRA,
  swept across the strengths you picked. This is what you want to answer "which of
  these is better".
- **🧬 Blend** loads them **together in the same image**, each at its own weight,
  and injects **every trigger word** into the prompt for you. This is what you want
  to answer "do these two work together" — a character plus a style, or a character
  plus a concept.

> This mode was called **🧬 Combine** until August 2026. Only the name changed;
> the ◉ LoRA Canvas offers the very same thing from the board, and calling it two
> different things was a needless thing to learn twice.

**What blending two characters actually gives you** is a *hybrid* — one person who
is neither of the two, not both of them side by side in one shot. That is a real
and deliberate use, but if you expected "my two characters together", this is not
it. The reliable pairings are **character + style** and **character + concept**.

In Blend mode the strength sweep disappears: each LoRA already carries its own
weight, so the run is one configuration instead of a grid. Start both around
0.7-0.9 — two LoRAs at 1.0 usually fight each other, and the one you care about
most should be the heavier of the two. Result tiles from a stack carry a **🧬**
badge naming the exact weights that made them.

**Steps and CFG are set in the same panel, in both modes.** They are render
settings, not LoRA settings, so they stay available when the strength sweep
disappears in Blend — and like every other axis, ticking two values renders both
(the cell counter shows what that costs before you launch). SDXL also exposes its
second pass there.

**Trying several weights at once.** Under each LoRA's slider is a row of weight
boxes. Tick two on one LoRA and two on the other, and the launch renders **all
four combinations** in a single run — the search you would otherwise do by
launching, looking, moving a slider and launching again. Each image is labelled
with its own pair, and the stack view lines the combinations up side by side so
you can pick the one that works and save its weights with ★.

Tick nothing and the slider governs, exactly as before the boxes existed; the
slider is also how you use a weight that is not on the grid. Tick one box and you
get one configuration — one image — like any other blend.

The count is spelled out before you launch ("4 weight combinations → 4 images,
about 1 min"), and past 24 images it turns amber and says so. It never refuses:
the queue is serial and it is your machine. Two LoRAs at four weights each is 16
images — the multiplication is quick, which is exactly why the panel does it for
you.

**One family per run, always.** A Krea LoRA and an SDXL LoRA cannot be blended:
they need different base models and different workflows. The picker greys out the
other families as soon as you check one, and a run that somehow mixes them is
refused with both family names in the message.

### Enhance a short prompt

**✨ Enhance** rewrites what you typed into a fuller prompt using your local Ollama
model — it adds framing, pose, lighting, background and mood, and deliberately
leaves identity and trigger words alone (the LoRA supplies the identity, and Studio
injects the trigger itself at generation time).

It is a local feature: without Ollama installed, running, and with its model pulled,
the button is **greyed out and says which of the three is missing** rather than
failing when you press it. Install or start it from **Settings › Local tools**.

### Reuse a dataset caption in Studio

Press **🎲 Caption** for a realistic test prompt from work you already curated.
The first use asks which dataset to draw from; after that, each main-button click
inserts a random **nonblank caption from a kept image** in that dataset. Studio
remembers the chosen source in this browser's localStorage. Use **▾** beside the
button to change the source dataset.

The source needs at least one kept image with a nonblank caption. If you have
typed a prompt, Studio asks before replacing it.

### Continue a run instead of starting over

If the best checkpoint is *almost* there — the identity nearly locked but a touch
undercooked — you don't have to retrain from scratch. The **▶ Continue training**
button (on the dataset's Checkpoints panel and on the **Runs** hub) opens a small
dialog:

- **Resume from** — which checkpoint to restart from. The default is the latest,
  but the whole point is that you can pick an **earlier, less-cooked epoch**: the
  classic case where step 750 held up better than the over-cooked 1000. Choosing
  an earlier step never destroys the run's later saves — they're set aside intact
  on disk, and the continuation writes
  its own.
- **Extra steps** — how many *more* steps to train; the dialog shows the target
  step you'll land on.
- **Adjust settings (optional)** — a resume can only safely change a handful of
  things: the **checkpoint/preview cadence**, the **preview prompts** (test images
  only — never the weights), and the **timestep weighting**. Everything structural
  (rank, base model, optimizer) is locked to the checkpoint you're continuing.
  The timestep knob enables a known **two-phase recipe**: train balanced first,
  then continue with a low-noise-leaning emphasis to polish fine texture.

- **Run it** — on this machine's GPU. A checkpoint is just a file, so one trained
  elsewhere can be continued here just the same. This fork has **no rented-GPU
  lane** — upstream's ☁ Cloud choice is removed, and a continuation always runs
  on the Primary's own card. When it can't run at all — no ai-toolkit, a training
  already going here — the button is disabled **with the reason**, never hidden.
  The **Runs** page's ▶ Continue behaves identically, counting that reason
  against *that run's* dataset, since the page lists runs from all of them.

You can also click a checkpoint pill in the **◉ Graph** and pick *▶ Continue from
here*: the dialog opens already set on that step.

Continue also works from the Runs hub, for any run listed there.

## 7. Dual captions (long + short)

An optional, **off-by-default** training technique, toggled under **⚙️ Advanced
options → Dual captions** on the training panel. When on, the run uses
ai-toolkit's native `short_and_long_captions`: **every image trains with both its
full caption and a short one.** It's a *text-side augmentation* — showing the
model two phrasings of the same image so the LoRA leans less on any single
wording and generalizes to prompts that don't match your caption style.

How the short caption is produced:

- It's **derived from the long caption**, automatically, the next time you
  (re-)caption — text-only, via the local vision model. Turning the toggle on
  doesn't rewrite anything by itself; **re-caption** to generate the shorts.
- It follows the **same kind rules** as the long one: no trigger word, and the
  identity / concept / aesthetic stays omitted (that's still the trigger's job).
- You can **edit it per image** in the **⛶** caption editor, next to the long one.

**Not carried by every lane.** A dataset staged for a machine that has no copy of the
JSON file the short caption is read from trains on the long caption alone; on this
fork every run is local, so the toggle applies to all of them.

**Not on Krea 2 or Anima.** Those two families pre-cache their text embeddings and
unload the text encoder to fit their DiT in VRAM. ai-toolkit caches exactly one
embedding per image — the long caption — and once the encoder is gone the training
loop reads those cached embeddings instead of the caption text, so a second caption
has nowhere to be encoded. Asking for both used to crash the run at the first step,
*after* the weights download and the whole caching pass (reported by **1Tomber**,
GitHub #22). The app now refuses the combination when it builds the training config:
the toggle says so, the pre-launch check warns, and the run trains on the long
caption alone — trigger word included, exactly like a normal run.

---

## 8. Concept LoRAs: keeping faces out

A Concept LoRA learns the one thing every image shares. If those images all show
people, it quietly learns **their faces too** — and when you later stack it with a
Character LoRA, the two pull against each other over whose face to render. This was
reported by **shivdbz2010 (GitHub)**.

Turn on **Mask faces** in *Advanced options* on a Concept dataset. Faces are
detected and **weighed down in the training loss**, so the concept binds to the act
instead of to the people in your photos.

**Your images are not touched.** Nothing is blurred, pixelated or painted over.
That distinction matters: a blurred face would *be* what the model is trained to
reproduce, and the LoRA would learn to render blurry faces. A loss mask says
"don't correct me here" instead, so nothing at all is learned in that area.

Before you rely on it:

- **Variety beats masking.** The people who maintain these trainers say dataset
  diversity matters more here. A concept demonstrated by ten different people
  already dilutes identity; with two, the faces are as constant as the concept and
  no mask fully compensates.
- **Preview it.** The training panel draws the mask on your own shots and shows how
  many images got no face at all. A *partly* masked set is the bad case: the faces
  left unmasked become the only ones the LoRA still learns faces from, so they end
  up over-represented.
- **If your concept lives on the face** — an expression, a mouth, a gaze — masking
  the head can erase what you're teaching. The app warns when your description says
  so; it doesn't stop you, because only you know your dataset.
- **Nobody has measured this.** There's no published before/after of a concept LoRA
  trained with and without face masking. This gives you the lever, not a promise.

Two knobs live in **Settings ▸ Training**: how far the detected face box is grown
into a head, and how much the masked area still counts. Neither is zero, on
purpose — see the settings reference.

---

## 9. Coverage — what your set never showed

Section 2 says "vary everything except the person". The Composition bar cannot
check that: it counts face / bust / body / back against a target, so a set of
twenty-five front-on studio portraits in one outfit reaches a **fully green
target** while having no profile, no daylight and no second outfit. The LoRA that
comes out reproduces that one look and nothing else.

**🔍 Coverage**, the collapsible panel right under the Composition bar, is that
second check. Open it and it reports, per axis, what your captions describe and
what they never mention:

| Axis | What a gap means |
|---|---|
| Camera view | frontal / three-quarter / profile — a character with no profile has a side nobody ever saw |
| Camera height | eye level / low / high / overhead — eye-level-only is the default trap |
| Lighting | daylight, indoor, golden hour, studio, night, backlit, overcast |
| Setting | indoor, outdoor, urban, plain backdrop, water, vehicle |
| Outfit | counts how many **distinct** outfit types appear — one outfit gets learned as part of the person |
| Expression | counts how many distinct expressions appear |

Which axes apply depends on the dataset kind. A **style** dataset is judged on
lighting, setting and view only — "one outfit" is not a defect when the outfit is
not what you are teaching. A **concept** dataset drops the expression axis.

### What it can and cannot see

This is deliberately a cheap check, not a second model. It reads **the words in
the captions you already generated** — nothing new runs, there is no GPU cost,
and the numbers appear instantly. That comes with real limits, and the panel
repeats them on screen rather than hiding them:

- **No captions, no reading.** With an uncaptioned dataset the panel says so
  instead of drawing empty bars. Run the caption pass first.
- **It sees descriptions, not pixels.** A profile shot the captioner described
  without the word "profile" is invisible here. An absence is strong evidence,
  not proof.
- **Negation is not parsed.** "not smiling" counts as a smile.
- **Under five captions it refuses to judge** — at that size everything looks
  missing for the wrong reason.
- **It never selects, keeps, rejects or changes anything.** It is advice.

The panel reads the same pool the Composition bar counts: everything that is not
rejected and not failed. It also tells you how many images have **no shot type
yet**, which is the one thing the bar above silently drops.
